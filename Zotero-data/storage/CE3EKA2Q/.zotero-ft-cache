I. INTRODUCTION AND RELIEF REQUESTED

2

Seventeen states and the District of Columbia1 (collectively, the States) filed this lawsuit

3 to protect themselves and their residents from the Trump Administration’s policy of forcibly
4 separating families who enter the country along its Southwestern border and related illegal
5

6 practices. Among other relief, the States seek an order that 1) enjoins the federal government

7 from refusing to process asylum seekers who arrive at Southwestern border ports of entry;

8 2) declares family separation for deterrence illegal; 3) requires prompt family reunification for

9 those already separated; 4) prevents immigration officials from predicating familial reunification

10 on the withdrawal of asylum claims, acquiescence to removal, payment of the costs of

11 reunification, or other conditions unrelated to the safety of the child; and 5) confirms that the
12

indefinite detention of families by the federal government is illegal. 13

14

Most Plaintiff States know that separated parents2 or children3 have been relocated within

15 their borders—but several States have been unable to speak with them.4 The States have

17

1 Specifically, the States of Washington, California, Maryland, Oregon, New Mexico, New

18 Jersey, New York, Iowa, Illinois, Minnesota, Rhode Island, Vermont, North Carolina, and Delaware; the Commonwealths of Massachusetts, Pennsylvania, and Virginia; and the District of Columbia.

19

2As of the date of this motion, the Department of Homeland Security (DHS) is detaining

20

separated parents in Plaintiff States Washington, Oregon, California, New Jersey, Maryland, and New Mexico. Complaint ¶¶ 300-03, 307, 312-13, 319, 336, 315-16; Decls. of Blumenauer ¶ 6 (Ex. 25); Jayapal

3 As of June 25, 2018, the Office of Refugee Resettlement (ORR) admits it has placed over 500 23 separated children in at least nine Plaintiff States. See Clinton Ex. D. In addition to those states that

Defendants acknowledge have received traumatized children, the Plaintiff States of Massachusetts, 24 Minnesota, and the District of Columbia have confirmed that they, too, have received separated children.

Hours after the States filed this lawsuit, the District Court for the Southern District of

7 California issued a preliminary injunction on behalf of a national class of parents, ordering the

8 federal government to promote family contact and setting deadlines for family reunification.

10 (S.D. Cal. June 26, 2018) (Ms. L Order). While the States agree that emergency relief for these
11 families is necessary, the Ms. L Order further increases the risk that Defendants will move
12 parents and children before their testimony can be taken. Moreover, the States have claims and
13 14 interests that extend beyond the relief granted by the Ms. L Order.5 It does not address

15 Defendants’ refusal to accept asylum seekers at Southwestern ports of entry, the conditions that

16 they are attaching to reunification (e.g., withdrawal of asylum claims or payment of travel costs

17 for ORR employees and separated children to be reunited with the parent), or their alternative
18 proposals to indefinitely detain families at unlicensed locations or summarily deport them.
19 Pursuant to Local Rules 7(d)(2), 16 and 26(d)(1), the States seek expedited discovery to
20 obtain and preserve evidence concerning the government’s family separation policy and its
21
22 related practices.6 See Appendix A (detailing specific topics for discovery). This relief is

2 they constantly change position, and they have already caused deep and enduring harm. The

3 States have attempted to confer with Defendants but have been unable to reach agreement.7
4 II. PERTINENT FACTS
5

6

This spring, Defendants implemented a long-threatened policy of forcibly separating

7 parents from their children when they enter our country through the Southwestern border, a

8 policy expressly intended to terrify families and deter future immigrants from entering the United

9 States. See, e.g., Compl. ¶¶ 53, 55, 65, 67, 119. At the same time, Defendants have accelerated
10 their practice of turning away asylum seekers, including families with small children, who 11
present themselves at Southwestern ports of entry—a practice that encourages unlawful entry 12
and thus artificially increases such violations. Id. ¶ 58; see also Decls. of Mensing ¶ 4(c) 13
14 (Ex. 22); Levy ¶¶ 20-38, 43-45 (Ex. 1); Ramos ¶¶ 59-60 (Ex. 3). Recent reports confirm that

15 Defendants are now using separated children to coerce parents to withdraw asylum claims or

16 agree to deportation in order to expedite reunification. Id. ¶¶ 100-102 (Exs. 37-38); see also

17 Decls. of Blumenauer ¶ 23 (Ex. 25); Griffith ¶ 12 (Ex. 29) (concern re long separation). Despite
18 the Ms. L Order requiring them to reunify families, Defendants are conditioning reunification on
19 onerous logistical and financial terms (such as the payment of travel costs for the child and
20 government escorts) many parents cannot hope to satisfy. Decls. of Levy ¶¶ 46-51(Ex.1); Ramos

Unless required to protect a child’s safety, forced separation is known to cause immediate

2 and extreme psychological harm to both children and their parents, and the resulting cognitive
3 and emotional damage can be permanent. Compl. Exs. 43, 79-86.9 The longer the separation

7 detained. See Compl. ¶¶ 70-71; Clinton Decl. Ex. F. Many professionals who have interviewed

8 or worked with the separated parents and children in recent weeks have witnessed the impacts

9 firsthand, and the States’ interviews of detainees in their jurisdictions confirm extensive harms,
10 especially where parents and children have not been allowed to contact each other.10 These
11 interviews also reflect the deplorable conditions of detention, including “iceboxes;” cages; lack

1 accounts that the States have already obtained confirm the terror that this policy has inflicted on
2 innocent children and their desperate parents. Defendants’ policies are causing fear and 3
disruption in the States’ immigrant communities, both because they target Latino populations 4
and because they harken back to some of the most destructive chapters in our history.12 The 5 6 ineffective policy has been condemned nearly universally. Compl. Exs. 77-87; Decl. of Wong
7 (Ex. 42).

8

On June 20, 2018, President Trump signed an Executive Order (EO) purporting to

9 suspend family separation. Compl. Ex. 24. But the EO does not actually require an end to family
10 separation, and in fact, it makes family unity contingent on the “availability of appropriations” 11
and exemptions from the requirements of the “Flores Settlement,” a 1997 agreement that 12
protects immigrant youth from indefinite detention. Compl. Ex. 30. Further, the EO appears 13
14 limited to those families who do not seek to stay in the United States. The EO does not moot

15 any of the States’ claims: there is no indication that funding will be appropriated, that

16 appropriate federal facilities exist and are available, or that the creation of new family internment

17 facilities is feasible or legal. Clinton Decl. Ex. G; Compl. Ex. 34.
18 Indeed, Defendants admit that “it is not possible for the U.S. government to detain
19 families together during the pendency of their immigration proceedings” without modifying the
20 provisions in the Flores Settlement that require expeditious release of detained minors and use
21
22 of non-secure facilities licensed by the state. Compl. Ex. 31 at 3. While Defendants seek to

1 19), the Flores court has already rejected similar attempts.13 Further, DHS has explained that
2 reunification efforts are only for “adults who are subject to removal” to reunite families solely 3
“for the purposes of removal,” i.e., not those seeking to remain in the country. Compl. 1. Ex. 35. 4
Defendants acknowledge that they intend to switch to a policy of indefinite family 5 6 detention or, alternatively, to resume family separations in the near future because of the
7 constraints provided by Flores and limited federal resources. For example, CBP Commissioner

8 Kevin McAleenan recently announced that he is unable to refer parents for prosecution without

9 separating them from their children due to lack of resources, but that situation is reportedly
10 temporary. Clinton Decl. Ex. H. White House Press Secretary Sarah Huckabee Sanders has 11
emphasized that the EO purporting to halt family separations “is a temporary solution. This isn’t 12
going to last . . . This will only last a short amount of time, because we’re going to run out of 13
14 space, we’re going to run out of resources to keep people together.” Secretary Sanders reiterated:

15 “We’re not changing the policy. We’re simply out of resources.” Clinton Decl. Ex. I.

16

Meanwhile, President Trump recently proposed simply deporting immigrants without

17 any legal process. Clinton Decl. Ex. J; Compl. Ex. 41. And Attorney General Sessions continues
18 to publicly adhere to the “zero-tolerance” directive requiring criminal prosecution of all migrants
19 who cross the Southwestern border outside a port of entry. Clinton Decl. Ex. H.

13 The government’s argument that the Flores Settlement Agreement’s licensure requirement does not apply to ICE family residential facilities (see Compl. Ex. 31 at 4) is a direct attack on the States’

23 sovereign interest in licensing, inspecting, and monitoring all out-of-home care providers (i.e., providers who care for children away from their parents), including federally funded ones. To ensure that all

24 facilities where children are placed out of the care of their parents meet minimum safety standards, the States have comprehensive laws and regulations that require, inter alia, current licensing, periodic

25 monitoring, meetings with staff and children, background checks, facility safety standards, and provision

of necessary and appropriate care to the children. Decls. of Reeves (Ex. 66); Chen (Ex. 65); Culley

The federal government has ignored the States’ repeated requests for information about

2 separated families. For example, on June 7, 2018 and again on June 18, 2018, Washington State
3 Governor Jay Inslee and Attorney General Bob Ferguson requested information about separated
4 children and parents; plans and timing for release or reunification; pending asylum claims; and
5
6 their access to legal information and attorneys. Id. Exs. A & B. Similarly, on June 19, 2018,

7 21 states and the District of Columbia sent a letter expressing concern about Defendants’ family

8 separation policy. Id. Ex. C. Federal lawmakers have sent similar letters. Id. Exs. K, L, M;

9 Compl. Exs. 7, 45. These requests were ignored.

10

The States have also attempted to interview potential witnesses over whom Defendants

11 have custody and control and the federal government has delayed or obstructed some of those
12
efforts.14 As a result, the States are forced to rely in part on media reports about the government’s 13

14 shifting conduct, as well as vacillating public statements from the Administration.15 Indeed, in

15 granting preliminary relief, the Ms. L. Court expressed dismay that the government had not

16 adequately tracked separated children and their parents, facilitated communication between

17 them, or planned for reunification, noting that it accounted for property better than it accounted
18 for the children it had taken from their parents. Ms. L, 2018 WL 3129486 *7.
19 Meanwhile, the States and their residents continue to suffer harm from family separation
20 and related practices—including the severe harms described above—even after the issuance of
21
22 the preliminary injunction. For example, reports are emerging that some separated parents who

3 “the reasonableness of the request in light of all the surrounding circumstances.” Semitool, Inc.
4 v. Tokyo Electron Am. Inc., 208 F.R.D. 273, 275 (N.D. Cal. 2002) (internal quotations and

“ ‘Good cause may be found where the need for expedited discovery, in consideration of

8 the administration of justice, outweighs the prejudice to the responding party.’ ” In re

9 Countrywide Fin. Corp. Derivative Litig., 542 F. Supp. 2d 1160, 1179 (C.D. Cal. 2008) (quoting
10 Semitool, 208 F.R.D. at 276). Need outweighs potential prejudice in cases where physical 11
evidence may be moved or difficult to track with the passage of time, thereby disadvantaging 12
one or more parties to the litigation. Cf. Pod-Ners, LLC v. N. Feed & Bean of Lucerne Liab. 13
14 Co., 204 F.R.D. 675, 676 (D. Colo. 2002) (anticipated movement of field beans made ordinary
15 discovery “unusually difficult or impossible.”). Indeed, if a party’s movement of beans is

16 sufficient for expedited discovery, surely the movement of human beings must be. Cf. id. at 676.

17

Here, numerous factors support the States’ request. Expedited discovery is needed to

18 enable the States to obtain evidence and testimony from people over whom the Defendants have
19 control, to determine the extent of the harm inflicted on State programs and residents, and to
20
evaluate the need for interim emergency relief. The States also need to obtain discovery related 21

1 relief available under the INA; and that Defendants are preparing to house children in unlicensed
2 facilities to evade State standards. Compl. at 119-120. 3
As noted, Defendants have sole control over key witnesses and evidence, including the 4
separated children and parents located in the Plaintiff States, but they cannot be relied upon to 5 6 accurately track the location of either. See Ms. L. 2018 WL 3129486 *7. Access to these
7 potential witnesses and information about them is critical.19 Moreover, many of the key

8 witnesses will likely be moved in the coming days and weeks with no assurances as to their well-

9 being or whereabouts, and continued chaos is inevitable. Id. at 9 (the government does not have
10 “any affirmative reunification procedure for [separated] parents and children”).20 Nor have the 11
States delayed their requests: literally hundreds of government officials have previously 12
requested similar information to no avail. Defendants have been on notice of these requests for 13
14 weeks. Clinton Decl. Exs. A, B, C, K, L, M; Compl. Exs. 7, 45. While the States have tried to

15 obtain evidence from these witnesses, they have been frustrated in these efforts. See Decl. of

16 Poletti ¶¶ 34-38 (Ex. 2); Austria ¶¶ 3-10 (Ex. 37); Compl. ¶ 312; cf. Clinton Ex. E.

17

Moreover, the scope of the States’ requests is appropriate in relation to their purpose and

18 the interests at stake. While the government publically asserts that it has rescinded, at least
19 temporarily, its family separation policy, whether the rescission of an unconstitutional policy is

1 really a sham has been the proper subject of expedited discovery in at least one case. See Citizens
2 for Quality Educ. San Diego v. San Diego Unified Sch. Dist., No. 17-CV-1054-BAS-JMA, 2018 3
WL 1150836, at *2-4 (S.D. Cal. Mar. 5, 2018). Likewise, discovery directed to the Defendants’ 4
recently announced strategies of indefinite family detention—or wholesale deportation without 5 6 any legal process—are necessary to both support the States’ claims and to enable them to seek
7 appropriate emergency relief if warranted. For example, on Friday, June 30, 2018, the

8 government took the position before the Flores court that the Ms. L Order exempts them from

9 legal restrictions on indefinite detention. See Flores, et al. v. Sessions, et al., Case No.
10 CV 85-4544-DMG (C.D. Cal.), Dkt. 447; Clinton Decl. Ex. P. 11
Under the circumstances presented here, “the administration of justice[ ] outweighs the 12
prejudice to the responding party.” See In re Countrywide, 542 F. Supp. 2d at 1179 13
14 (quoting Semitool 208 F.R.D. at 276). The expedited discovery requested is a limited subset of
15 what the States would pursue in discovery regardless. The only burden is that Defendants must

16 respond sooner, which is trivial compared to the immediate and real harms family separation and

17 related policies are causing. Further, the Defendants have already been ordered by a federal

18 court to reunify the separated children and parents. This will require the government to locate,
19 identify, and maintain information about all of the separated children and parents; providing this
20
information to the States adds very little additional burden. 21

22

Further, any burden to the Defendants also is mitigated by the request for regular

23 conferences with the Court. Defendants can raise any unforeseen challenge that the requests

24 pose during these status conferences—allowing Defendants to seek immediate relief if the 25 parties are unable to resolve a dispute. Finally, any logistical difficulty is a “chaotic 26

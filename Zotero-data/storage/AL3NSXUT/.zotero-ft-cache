Defendants.

14 I, Tom Torlakson, declare as follows:
15 1. I am a resident ofthe State of California. I am over the age of 18 and have personal
16 knowledge of all the facts stated herein. If called as a witness, I could and would testify
17 competently to the matters set forth below.
18 2. Since 2011, I have served as California's nonpartisan elected State
19 Superintendent of Public Instruction, and the head of the California Department of Education
20 ("CDE"). In my role, I direct all functions of CDE, act as the Secretary and Executive Officer
21 of the California State Board of Education ("SBE"), and execute the policies set by the SBE.
22 Before joining CDE I taught in Contra Costa County's Mount Diablo Unified School District
23 (where I remain a teacher-on-leave), served on the Antioch City Council, Contra Costa County
24 Board of Supervisors, and the California State Senate and State Assembly. During my tenure
25 in the California State Legislature, I acted to protect education funding, improve student

1 nutrition and physical education, and ensure school safety. I also sponsored legislation to

2 increase funding for textbooks, computers, and other instructional materials, and promoted

3 efforts to close the digital divide, eliminate the achievement gap, and reduce the dropout rate. !

4

3. I am familiar with the federal govermnent's "zero-tolerance" policy and

5 Executive Order "Affording Congress an Opportunity to Address Family Separation," which I

6 understand are being challenged in this case.

7

4. California guarantees all K-12 children in our state a free public education.

8 This includes all school-age children who reside in California regardless of their citizenship

9 status.

10

5. 'Each year, California public schools serve approximately 6,200,000 students

11 attending grades K-12. In compliance with state and federal law, California does not require

12 disclosure of a student's immigration status to attend school and participate in public education

13 programs. Based on reports issued by the federal govermnent, it is public knowledge that many

14 unaccompanied minors attend California public schools.

15

6. I am informed and believe, based on information I received from the CDE's

16 school fiscal services division, that on average, California spent over $14,000 per student in the

17 2017-18 school year. Included in the total K-12 funding was an additional $6,400 per students

18 for students in our special education programs, and approximately $2,400 additional funding

19 per student for students in English learner programs. Over 91% of California's K-12 funding

20 comes from state and local resources.

21

7. CDE administers several state and federal education programs to assist

22 unaccompanied minors. These programs include assistance with nutrition by way of free and

23 reduced cost lunch programs, before and after school programming, health programs, including

24 programs designed to assist students in learning English.

25

8. CDE also administers child development programs that are available to

26 unaccompanied minors. These programs include child development services for children from

1 birth through 12 years of age. These programs provide an educational component that is

2 developmentally, culturally, and linguistically appropriate for the children served. The

3 programs also provide meals and snacks to children, parent education, referrals to health and

4 social services for families, and staff development opportunities to employees. CDE

5 additionally administers a migrant child care and development program for families who earn

6 at least 50 percent of their total gross income from employment in fishing, agriculture or

7 agriculturally-related work.

8

9. Unaccompanied children like all students, are in strong need for comprehensive

9 student supportive services that promote academic success and address the whole child. The

10 CDE, in collaboration with the State Mental Health Policy Workgroup and other stakeholders,

11 advocate for increased services, resources, funding, training, and policy change to better

12 support the mental health and wellness of all students, including immigrant students. The COE

13 also provides mental health first aid training to help school staff identify and support students

14 who may be experiencing a mental health challenge or is in crisis. These services are

15 particularly important for children who have suffered any form of trauma, such as traumatic

16 separation from their parents.

17

10. Under Title III of the federal Elementary and Secondar)I Education Act, as

18 amended by the Every Students Succeeds Act, COE is required to set aside funds to provide

19 subgrant awards to local educational agencies (LEAs) that meet eligibility requirements for

20 participation in the Title III Immigrant Student Education Subgrant Program. Title III

21 Immigrant Student Education Program flmds are to be specifically targeted to eligible

22 immigrant students and their families through the provision of supplementary programs and

23 services for the underlying purpose of assuring that these students meet the same challenging

24 grade level and graduation standards as mainstream students. The federal grants amounts have

25 not increased proportionally witl1 the increase in eligible students, including unaccompanied

26 children that have arrived in California over the past few years, and the COE has not received

1 any indication of any forthcoming increase in federal funding as a result of the forcible

2 separation of children.

3

11. In 2014, the number of unaccompanied minors served by California schools

4 dramatically increased when the State experienced an influx of unaccompanied children. In

5 response, during the 2014-2015 school year, CDE identified $3.5 million in federal funding to

6 assist schools that saw an increase in unaccompanied immigrant children. The funds were

7 dedicated to improve instruction, provide tutoring and intensified instruction, and to conduct

8 community participation programs.

9

12. In addition, in 2015, the US ED allocated an additional $1.8 million in federal

10 Title III funds to address the needs associated with the increase in unaccompanied immigrant

11 children.

12

13. Unaccompanied children who attend California public schools often have a

13 need for services, including mental health, due to trauma experienced in their countries of

14 origin and at the border while in custody. Research supported by the Substance Abuse and

15 Mental Health Services Administration confirm that adverse childhood experiences including

16 trauma, parental separation and parental incarceration are strongly related to the development

17 and prevalence of a wide range of health problems throughout a person's lifespan. If our

18 schools experience an influx of children who have undergone severe trauma, including the

19 forcible separation from parents, transfer from various locations around the country, and

20 incarceration in immigration detention facilities, additional resources will need to be allocated

21 to offer them services that they may not have otherwise required.

22

14. In my experience and in my opinion as a long time educator, unaccompanied

23 immigrant children like all children, are better able to integrate into our public schools and learn

24 when they are in a healthy environment that is free of tratmm. By contrast, children who have

25 suffered trawnatic experiences often feel the effects of those experiences for years or even

1 I, Mary M. Bourque, declare as follows:
2 1. I am the Superintendent of Schools for the Chelsea Public Schools (“CPS”), a
3 school system serving a diverse population of 6,326 students from prekindergarten through
4 grade 12.
5 2. I have personal knowledge of the matters set forth below.
6 3. Eighty-six percent of CPS students identify as Hispanic, including large
7 populations of Salvadorans, Hondurans, and Guatemalans. Eighty-one percent of CPS students
8 have a first language that is not English, and CPS has the highest percentage of students in
9 Massachusetts who are English Language Learners (just under 40% of the entire student
10 population).
11 4. CPS is a gateway school system that welcomes many immigrant families and
12 educates all students and families, regardless of their immigration status.
13 5. To the extent that children separated from their parents at the southern border
14 are reunited with their parents or placed with sponsor families in Chelsea, they will be
15 welcomed by CPS and provided the full range of CPS’s services, as required by law.
16 6. The policy of separating children from their parents will cause harm to children
17 that will make it exponentially harder for CPS to educate these children.
18 7. Children who have been separated from their family may experience serious
19 trauma and uncertainty about their future; traumatic events have an impact on the brain and
20 brain development. Traumatic events and the impact on the prefrontal cortex of the brain leave
21 children in these cases living in a constant flight or fight status which makes it more
22 challenging for students to access learning. Many of these students are more likely to need
23 additional counseling services and emotional supports. Untreated trauma may lead to the need
24 for special education services. They are also more likely to have difficulty with self-regulation
25 and building trusting relationships.
26

Case 2:18-cv-00939-MJP Document 15-5 Filed 07/02/18 Page 33 of 165
1 8. Without parents to care for them, these children may also suffer from food or
2 housing insecurity.
3 9. They may also be vulnerable to trafficking and other exploitation.
4 10. CPS will incur additional costs as a result of the particular vulnerabilities of
5 children who have been separated from their parents. The Commonwealth of Massachusetts,
6 which funds CPS through a complex formula, will also incur additional costs. In Chelsea, state
7 funding accounts for more than 63 percent of education spending.
8 11. CPS social workers and guidance counselors may need to spend more time with
9 these students, to help them overcome the impacts of the trauma inflicted on them. Class sizes
10 will increase as money is taken from regular education in order to hire more social workers and
11 guidance counselors to address this increasing at-risk student population.
12 12. Children who suffer trauma are also more likely to require more intense special
13 education support services in the area of emotional impairment as a result of trauma, costing
14 the city and state additional money.
15 13. Addressing the social and emotional as well as mental health needs of these
16 students puts academics second to this urgency. As a result, state-mandated “accountability
17 status” – a rating between 1 and 5 given to the district by the state – is disproportionately lower
18 in cities such as Chelsea who are welcoming and educating these students. The impact of a
19 lower “accountability rating” is felt by the municipality most particularly in the area of real
20 estate; families do not want to purchase a home in an area with what is perceived as lower
21 performing schools. With respect to state costs, districts with a lower accountability rating
22 often receive additional funds and resources from the state to help improve results.
23 14. The ongoing fear of Immigration and Customs Enforcement (“ICE”) and
24 deportation, and increased ICE visibility, in the community has children arriving at school
25 upset, fearful, and in tears, and has led families to avoid seeking health and preventive
26

1 services. This delay in seeking care may lead to more serious health issues and may result in
2 higher costs for the state. These problems will only compound as immigrant children arrive in
3 the community after having been forcibly separated from their parents by immigration
4 officials.
5 15. Parents and guardians play an important role in CPS, partnering with schools
6 and advocating for the needs of their children. This partnership improves the education that
7 those children receive and the quality of the schools overall. For a child without a parent or
8 guardian, CPS teachers and administrators must take extra care to make sure that a child’s
9 educational needs are being met, requiring extra time and resources from the district and the
10 Commonwealth.
11 16. In conclusion, because of the policy of separating children from their parents at
12 the border, children arriving in Massachusetts will be welcomed into our schools, and they will
13 require a range of services to address the trauma they have experienced in order to prepare
14 them for learning.
15
16 I declare under penalty of perjury under the laws of the United States of America that the
17 foregoing is true and correct.

6. Public schools and school districts in Oregon are subject to all federal and state

2 laws and constitutional provisions prohibiting discrimination.

3

7. It is my understanding that the United State Supreme Comt held that children,

4 regardless of their immigration status or that of their parents or guardians, have a constitutional

5 right to receive a free public K-12 education. Plyer v. Doe, 457 U.S. 202 (1982). Thus, a child's

6 citizenship or immigration status does not determine whether the child is entitled to an education

7 Therefore, an immigrant or refugee child who has a parent, guardian, or person in a parental

8 relationship residing in Oregon, or is a foster child under the care of the Oregon Department of

9 Human Services or a tribal welfare agency, is entitled to a public education in Oregon.

10

8. Oregon state law requires school districts to provide a free appropriate public

11 education to all children between the ages of 5 and 19 who reside within the district. ORS

12 339. 115.

13

9. Individuals between the ages of 4 and 18 are considered resident for school

14 purposes in the school district in which their parents, their guardians or persons in parental

15 relationship 1 to them reside. ORS 339.133.

16

10. Individuals between the ages of 4 and 21 who are placed in foster care are a

17 resident of either the school district of origin or the school district where the individual resides

18 due to placement by the Department of Human Services or a tribal child welfare agency if, based

19 on consideration of all factors relating to the individual 's best interests, an Oregon juvenile court

20

21

22 1 ORS 339.133(1 )(b) defines "person in parental relationship" as:

(A) "Person in parental relationship" means an adult who has physical custody of an individual or

23

resides in the same household as the individual, interacts with the individual daily, provides the

individual with food, clothing, shelter and incidental necessaries and provides the individual with

24

necessary care, education and discipline.

(B) "Person in parental relationship" does not mean a person with a power of attorney or other written

25

delegation of parental responsibi lities if the person does not have other evidence of a parental relationship.

Plaintiffs, v.

DECLARATION OF JAMES LANE

DONALD TRUMP in his official capacity as President of the United States, et al.,

Defendants.

DECLARATION OF JAMES LANE I, James F. Lane, declare that the following facts are true to the best of my knowledge, information and belief: 1. I am Virginia’s Superintendent of Public Instruction. In this capacity, I serve as the Executive Officer of the Virginia Department of Education (“VDOE”) and the Secretary of the Virginia Board of Education. Prior to my appointment as Virginia’s Chief School Officer, I served as a Division Superintendent in Chesterfield County, Goochland County, and Middlesex County. I was recognized as the 2017 Virginia Superintendent of the Year for my leadership in Goochland County. I was also one of 100 Superintendents in the nation selected to attend the 2014 Connected Superintendents Summit at the White House in recognition of my leadership in the use of instructional technology. I hold a Doctorate degree in Education from the University of Virginia, and Master’s and Bachelor’s degrees in Teaching from the University of North Carolina at Chapel Hill. I have personal knowledge of the matters set forth below or have knowledge of those matters based on my review of information and records gathered by members of my staff.
1

Case 2:18-cv-00939-MJP Document 15-5 Filed 07/02/18 Page 94 of 165
2. The mission of the Virginia Board of Education and the Superintendent of Public Instruction, in cooperation with local school boards, is to increase student learning and academic achievement. The VDOE is the administrative agency for Virginia’s public schools. VDOE’s mission is to lead and facilitate the development and implementation of a quality public education system that meets the needs of students and assists them in becoming educated, productive, responsible, and self-reliant citizens.
3. Federal and Virginia law requires Virginia public schools to provide all children, regardless of national origin, immigration or citizenship status, with equal access to public education at the elementary and secondary level. This mandate includes providing equal access to public education to unaccompanied children who may be involved in immigration proceedings, including those unaccompanied children separated from their families at the southern border of the United States. Once these children are released to a sponsor, they have a right to enroll in Virginia schools, regardless of their immigration status.
4. The VDOE provides the state share of the cost for educating students enrolled in public schools, and the enrolling local school division is responsible for paying the local share of the cost for educating students enrolled in public schools at a total per pupil statewide average expenditure in excess of $10,000.
5. Unaccompanied children who have been separated from their families at the southern border of the United States, transported and housed in Virginia will likely result in the additional expenditure of limited state resources in the area of public education, including education costs and additional support services needed in the school setting, such as traumainformed care strategies and school mental health/psychological services for this vulnerable population.

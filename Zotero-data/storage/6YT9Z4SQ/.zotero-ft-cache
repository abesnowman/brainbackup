11 declare under penalty ofperjury pursuant to 28 U.S.C. § 1746 that the following is true and

12
correct: 13

I am the director ofpolicy at Kids in Need of Defense (KIND). KIND is a national non-

15

profit organization with ten field offices providing free legal services to unaccompanied

immigrant children who face removal proceedings in Immigration Court. Since 2009,

17

KIND has received referrals for over 15,800 children from 70 countries, and has partnered

18 with pro bono counsel at over 500 law firms, corporations, law schools, and bar
19
associations. KIND also advocates for changes in law, policy, 20

and practice to enhance protections for unaccompanied children. Since 2010, KIND has also run a return and reintegration program for children who return to their country of origin.

2. KIND has served children who arrived in the United States with parents from whom they

were separated by federal officials.

During interviews with children, KIND staff seek to determine whether children entered the country with parents from whom they were separated, and will inquire into the circumstances. Several children have reported experiencing distress and confusion at being separated from parents. For example, a seven-year-old girl reported crying throughout two days

7

spent in a Border Patrol holding facility, and asking to be reunited with her mother. Other

children have reported worrying about their parents, because they did not know what happened to them after the separation. Through our work representing the children in legal proceedings, as well as supporting those who return to the country of origin, it is evident to KIND that there is no consistent policy for ensuring communication among separated children and parents. Some

14 15 16 17 18 19 6.

children served by KIND were allowed to communicate with parents by telephone after separation. In other cases, children reported that the government did not allow any communication with a parent while the child was in detention, or that children did not know the whereabouts of their parents. In order to provide adequate legal representation to children in removal proceedings, it is

20

important for the attorney to have a thorough understanding of the child's situation in the

country of origin. Attorneys must ask difficult questions about abuse, abandonment,

neglect, violence, persecution, or other harms suffered by children and their families in

the country of origin. Children may qualify for humanitarian protection on several

grounds, and past harm to the child or to family members may support eligibility for legal

relief. A child may have limited memory and understanding of complex or violent

situations, making it important for the attorney to speak with members of a child's family who may corroborate information, fill in gaps, and provide additional facts the child might not know or comprehend. Children who were separated from their parents following DHS apprehension may not know where the parent is or how to contact them. Parents of KIND clients may be held

8. 10 11 12 13

in the custody oflmmigration and Customs Enforcement or the U.S. Marshall, or may even be back in the country of origin before the child begins working with an attorney. Separation from parents makes it harder for the child to provide the evidence necessary to prove their defense from removal. Many times, the parent has important paperwork, such as notarized affidavits, birth certificates, or police records. Obtaining these documents from a parent who is detained or deported is difficult and resource-intensive.

14 9. KIND's Return and Reintegration Project has worked with several children who were

15

separated from their parents following apprehension, and sought voluntary departure

16 from the Immigration Judge in order to reunite with a parent and return together to their
17
country of origin. In several such cases, the government was unable to coordinate the 18

19

return of the parent and child, and the children had to face the return journey alone.

20

Several of these cases involved very young children.

10. When a child is separated from a parent and rendered unaccompanied, the child's legal

case is generally severed from the parent's. Under the Trafficking Victims Protection

Reauthorization Act of 2008, unaccompanied alien children are entitled to be heard in

removal proceedings before an Immigration Judge. A separated child has his or her own

removal case, separate from the parent's matter, which may be expedited and may not be

1

referred to the Immigration Court. Thus, the child's and parent's cases may proceed as

2
two separate matters, often in different tribunals and on very different schedules,
3 although the family members may share in common underlying facts, claims for relief,
4
and evidence.

3. During our visit, I met two men who had had their children taken from them by federal

2 immigration officials under the Trump Administration's family separation policy. Both had to

3 wait for weeks to hear from their children again.

4

4. One man-whom the Washington Post referred to as Carlos-fled Honduras after gang

5 violence in that country threatened his life and that of his 7-year-old son. Carlos fled with his

6 son by train and was arrested by federal officers on March 10, 2018, when they crossed the U.S.

7 border into El Paso, Texas. Carlos told me that he sought asylum and yet was held in leg irons

8 for several days, with his son by his side. Then his son was removed. Three months passed

9 before Carlos was able to speak to his son again. At that time, his son was being housed in a

10 care facility located in Michigan.

11

5. Carlos had the foresight to make his son memorize a relative's phone number before they

12 left Honduras. As a result, his son was able to contact the relative, who connected him to another

13 family member in the United States. Carlos still did not know when he would be able to see his

14 son agam.

15

6. The second man-whom the Washington Post referred to as Mario-also fled Honduras,

16 by bus, accompanied by his sister and his 5-year-old daughter. Mario told me that his sister was

17 a victim of domestic violence committed by a police officer in Honduras. When the family

18 attempted to press charges, a gang beat Mario up.

19

7. Mario, his daughter, and his sister surrendered to U.S. Customs and Border Patrol on

20 April 20. Mario told me that he and his sister had both sought asylum. According to Mario, his

21 sister was ultimately granted asylum, but he and his daughter were placed in an ICE holding

22 facility. Conditions in the facility were difficult; the room in which they were kept was frigid

23 and little more than a prison cell. After three days, Mario told us, an officer approached him and

24 told him to give up his daughter or she would be taken away. Mario told us that his 5-year-old

25 girl was dragged away from him crying and screaming, which was the last he saw her. Mario 26

1 told us that he finally heard from his daughter in mid-June but he still did not know where she
2 was being held.

3

8. Mario and Carlos both told us that they were seeking asylum in the United States and

4 that they had entered the country through legitimate points of entry. Neither knew where in the

5 asylum process their cases stood.

6

9. Both men visibly struggled to maintain their composure while recounting the trauma that

7 they experienced since coming to the United States and ultimately broke down into tears. Our

8 interpreter too broke down into tears, finding their stories too painful to bear.

9

l 0. Carlos and Mario told us that a third man who had been separated from his children under

10 the Trump Administration's policy was also being held in the facility but we were not able to 11 speak with him during my visit. In response to our questions, ICE officials indicated that they

12 did not know how many parents they were holding who had been separated from their children

13 under the Administration's policy.

14

11. I have asked ICE officials whether detainees or children were being held in Maryland.

15 ICE officials have confirmed that parents and children separated from one another pursuant to

16 the Trump Administration's family separation policy are being kept in child care and detention

17 centers in Maryland.

Defendants.

14 I, Francisco Serrano, declare as follows:
15 1. I am over the age of 18 and have personal knowledge of the facts herein. If called
16 as a witness, I could and would testify competently to the matters set forth below.
17 2. 1 reside in the District of Columbia. I live with my wife, my mother, and my two
18 children who are fifteen- and seventeen-years-old.
19 3. In May 2018, my niece Maria called me to tell me that she had traveled from El
20 Salvador with a caravan, that she was at the Mexico-United States border and that she was going
21 to cross the border by San Ysidro. She also told me that she was traveling with her two children,
22 M. who is 7 years old and N. who is 2 years old.
23 4. Approximately a week later I received a call from a shelter indicating that the
24 children were going to be separated from Maria, that they were on their way to New York, that
25 Maria had designated me as a sponsor and asking me whether I was willing to be the sponsor. I

I told the person that I would be the sponsor and then the person told me that I would be able to

2 talk to the children twice a week. Attached hereto as Exhibits 1 and 2 are the forms I was told

3 to complete in early May 2018 so that I could receive Maria's two sons.

4

5. I have spoken with the seven-year-old on several occasions since the family

5 arrived. He told me that officials told him that he and his baby brother were being taken to a

6 detention center in Washington, D.C. to be closer to me, their uncle. I received a phone call from

7 the seven-year-old who thought he was in Washington, D.C., but he was not. He was in New

8 York. I was told by a social worker that the two young boys are in Lutheran Youth Hostel of

9 New York.

10

6. To become the sponsor the social worker told me that I had to provide: 1) Maria's

11 mother's birth certificate, 2) Maria's birth certificate, 3) the kids' birth certificates, and 4) my

12 birth certificate, driver's license, passport and proof of citizenship. In addition to completing the

13 paperwork, I had to provide copies of my identification and police record. I did not have copies

14 of Maria's mother's, Maria's or the kids' birth certificates so I had to ask persons in El Salvador

15 to send them to me. This process took 5 days because a friend was in El Salvador and was able

16 to help me, otherwise the process would have taken 15 to 20 days.

17

7. The social worker who was working with the kids told me that once I submitted

18 the documents she would get approval within 36 hours and the children would be released within

19 24 hours after that. I did not hear from them within 36 hours, but I assumed that everything was

20 valid because I had completed all of the forms and followed all of the instructions.

21

8. Approximately one week after I provided the paperwork I was told that I had to

22 be fingerprinted. The next day I took time off work and got fingerprinted.

23

9. After I submitted all the requested documents the social worker told me that she

24 was very sorry but that she had only been able to get one of the approvals she needed to approve

25 the paperwork. She said that she did everything she could but it was out of her hands.

10. In late May 2018, I received a power of attorney from my niece Maria giving me

2 the authorization to care for her two minor sons. A copy of the notarized power of attorney is

3 attached hereto as Exhibit 3. I provided a copy of this power of attorney to the social worker in

4 early June 2018.

5

11. About a week later I was asked to complete a certified form for a further

6 background check. On June 1, 2018, I completed the additional form that Lutheran Social

7 Services had provided to me to get authorization to receive Maria's two sons. I had to have the

8 form notarized. A copy of that form is attached hereto as Exhibit 4.

9

12. Then I was informed that I passed the background check but they needed one

10 more week to release the kids to me. The seven-year-old boy called me and told me that

11 officials had told him that he and his brother would be released to me in a week.

12

13. But then, I was told that they needed to perform a DNA test to confirm that

13 Maria is the children's mom. Recently, the social worker told me that a few days ago a

14 government employee went to Otay Mesa where Maria was detained to conduct the DNA test

15 but that Maria was not there. Later, when I spoke to Maria she said that she had been at Otay

16 Mesa the entire time.

17

14. Several weeks after I submitted all of the paperwork, on June 22, 2018, I was

18 told that the paperwork I submitted was wrong, the power of attorney was not valid, and the

19 boys would not be released to me. The social worker said that we will have to start the

20 sponsorship process again because the rules changed. She said that there were new forms we

21 had to complete, but she did not send me the forms until Friday, June 29, 2018. Those forms

22 are attached hereto as Exhibits 5 and 6.

23

15. On June 27 after borrowing money from family members, I was able to gather

24 $10,000 to post Maria's bond. An immigration agent told me that Maria would come out on

25 June 28, 2018 and that she would be taken to the bus station so she could take the bus to

26 1 Washington, D.C. So Maria's bus ticket was for June 28. But immigration released her on

I June 27 and Maria called me because the agents left her in a McDonald's and she did not have

2 any place to go or to sleep. She had to look for someone to take her in for one night and now

3 she in on the way to Washington, D.C.

4

16. On June 28, 2018, I talked to the social worker who told me that we will have to

5 start the sponsorship process again and that Maria will have to fill the application and request

6 the children because she already was released from immigration detention.

7

17. I am concerned that now the process for Maria's children to be reunited with my

8 family will have to start all over again. Everyone in my home, including my 78-year-old

9 mother, will have to submit fingerprints, police records, and identification, and we will have to

10 complete a new application form. Because of my mother's age, it is difficult to get her

11 fingerprints, and immigration officials previously told her that she would not have to submit

12 fingerprints again. I was told that my niece Maria will also have to be fingerprinted and will

13 have to submit all the documentation, as well. I am concerned that Maria will not be able to

14 produce the right paperwork to be reunited with her sons. Maria does not have a passport, and

15 all she has is an ID card from El Salvador.

16

18. All this process has been very difficult for my family:

17

a. At first when I would talk to M., the 7-year-old, he was very talkative and

18 excited because the social worker told him he would be out within a week. When the time came

19 that M. expected to be released and nothing happened he sounded depressed, he would not say

20 much and wanted to cry. M. asked me why I had not picked him up yet. The social worker told

21 me that M. is depressed and asked me for words of encouragement to cheer him up. Yesterday,

22 June 28, 1 spoke with him and he is glad because he thinks that soon he is going to be reunited

23 with his mother. I am worried about M.'s mental health when he learns that we have to start the

24 process again and that he is not going to be released soon.

25

b. Because I am only able to speak on the phone and N. is too young, I have

26 1 not been able to speak with him at all. M. told me that N. cries all the time, and that the only

1 time that the kids see each other is at night. M. told me that they let N. stay with him at night

2 because he is the only one with whom N. won't cry.

3

C. When I speak with Maria she asks for an update about the children and is

4 speechless when I tell her that I am still waiting for approval. She cries. She has only been able

5 to speak with the kids a few times.

6

d.

The most affected person by all this is my mother. She raised Maria after

7 her mother died when Maria was 8 months old. At first, I did not want to tell my mom what was

8 happening because she is 78 years old and I was concerned that the news would adversely impact

9 her health. I only told her that Maria and the kids had crossed the border but were detained.

10 After watching news, my mom demanded I tell her what was happening. My mom became ill

11 when I told her that the kids had been separated from Maria. Ever since my morn found out

12 about the family separation, she has had an intense headache and I had to take her to see a doctor.

13 I am really concerned about my mom's health. For Maria, the separation from her kids repeats

14 the story as when she lost her mother.

15

e. On my part, this process has been very depressive and frustrating. When

16 I finally thought that they were going to give me the children they tell me no. I have also had to

17 take time off work to do all that has been asked of me.

18

19. 1am hopeful that Maria, M. and N. will be reunited soon.

I declare under penalty of perjury under the laws of the State of California and the laws

18 2. Yo resido en el Distrito de Columbia. Vivo con mi esposa, mi mama, y mis dos
19 hijos que tienen quince y diecisiete anos de edad.
20 3. En mayo de 2018, mi sobrina Maria me llam6 para decirme que habia viajado
21 desde El Salvador con una caravana, que estaba en la frontera de Mexico y los Estados Unidos,
22 y que iba a cruzar la frontera por San Ysidro. Tambi6n me dijo que estaba viajando con sus dos
23 ninos, M. de 7 anos de edad y N. de 2 anos de edad.
24 4. Aproximadamente una semana despues recibi una llamada de un albergue
25 diciendome que los ninos iban a ser separados de Maria, que iban rumbo a Nueva York, que

I Maria me habia designado como patrocinador y preguntandome que si yo estaba dispuesto a

2 ser el patrocinador. Yo le dije a la persona que serfa el patrocinador y la persona me dijo que

3 yo podria hablar con los ninos dos veces por semana. Adjunto los Documentos 1 y 2 son los

4 formularios que me dijeron que completara a principios de mayo para que pudiera recibir a los

5 ninos de Maria.

6

5. Yo he hablado con el nino de 7 anos en varias ocasiones desde que la familia

7 1leg6. El me dijo que oficiales le dijeron que a el y a su hermanito los iban a llevar a un centro

8 de detenci6n en Washington, D.C. para estar mas cerca de mf, sus tfo. Recibf una llamada del

9 nino de siete anos quien pensaba que estaba en Washington, D.C., pero no era asf. El estaba en

10 Nueva York. Una trabajadora social me dijo que los dos ninos estan Lutheran Youth Hostel en

11 Nueva York.

12

6. Para ser el patrocinador la trabajadora social me dijo que tenfa que proveer: 1) el

13 acta de nacimiento de la mama de Maria, 2) el acta de nacimiento de Maria, 3) las actas de

14 nacimiento de los ninos, y 4) mi acta de nacimiento, licencia de conducir, pasaporte y pruebas

15 de ciudadanfa. Ademas de completar el papeleo, tuve que proporcionar copias de mi

16 identificaci6n y registro policial. Yo no tenfa copias de las actas de nacimiento de la mama de

17 Maria, de Maria o de los ninos asi es que tuve que contactar a personas en El Salvador para que

18 me las enviaran. Este proceso tomo 5 dfas porque un amigo estaba en El Salvador y me pudo

19 ayudar, si no, el proceso hubiera durado de 15 a 20 dias.

20

7. La trabajadora social que estaba trabajando con los ninos me dijo que cuando yo

21 entregara los documentos ella obtendrfa aprobaci6n en 36 horas y los ninos saldrfan 24 horas

22 despues de eso. No escuche de ellos en las pr6ximas 36 horas, pero asumf que todo era valido

23 porque ya habia completado todos los formularios y seguido todas las instrucciones.

24

8. Aproximadamente una semana despues que proporcione el papeleo me dijeron

25 que me tenfan que tomar la huellas. El dfa siguiente pedf tiempo en mi trabajo y me tomaron las

26 huellas.

9. Despues de que entregu6 los documentos que me pidieron la trabajadora social

2 me dijo que to sentia mucho pero que solo habia obtenido una de las aprobaciones que necesitaba

3 para aprobar el papeleo. Ella dijo que hizo todo to posible pero que estaba fuera de sus manos.

4

10. A finales de mayo, recibi un poder legal de mi sobrina Maria ddndome la

5 autorizaci6n para cuidar de sus dos ninos menores. Una copia del poder legal notariado esta

6 adjunta como Documento 3. Yo proporcion6 el poder legal a la trabajadora social a principios

7 de junio.

8

11. Aproximadamente una semana despues me pidieron que completara una forma

9 certificada para una verificaci6n de antecedentes adicional. El primero de junio de 2018, yo

10 complete el formulario que me proporciono Lutheran Social Services para obtener la

11 autorizaci6n de recibir a los dos hijos de Maria. Tuve que certificar el formulario por notario.

12 Una copia del formulario esta adjunto como Documento 4.

13

12. Luego me informaron que pas6 la verificaci6n de antecedentes, pero necesitaban

14 una semana Inds para entregarme a los ninos. Hable con el nino de siete anos y me dijo que los

15 oficiales le dijeron que a el y su hermano me los iban a entregar en una semana.

16

13. Pero luego me dijeron que necesitaban hacer una prueba de ADN para confirmar

17 que Maria es la mamd de los ninos. Recientemente, la trabajadora social me dijo que hace unos

18 dias un empleado del gobierno fue a Otay Mesa donde Maria estaba detenida para tomarle la

19 prueba de ADN pero Maria no estaba ahi. Despues, cuando habl6 con Maria ella dijo que habia

20 estado en Otay Mesa todo el tiempo.

21

14. El 22 de junio, varias semanas despues que entregue todo el papeleo me dijeron

22 que el papeleo que entregue estaba equivocado, que el poder legal no era vdlido, y que no me

23 iban a entregar a los ninos. Ella dijo que hay formularios nuevos que tenemos que completar,

24 pero no me envi6 los formularios hasta el viernes, 29 de junio de 2018. Esos formularios estdn

25 adjuntos como Documentos 5 y6.

15. El 27 de junio despuds de pedir dinero prestado a miembros de mi familia, pude

2 recolectar $10,000 y pagud la fianza de Maria Un agente de inmigraci6n me dijo que Maria

3 saldria el 28 de junio de 2018 y que la llevarian a estaci6n de autobus para que ella pudiera tomar

4 el autobus a Washington D.C. Asf es que el boleto de autobus de Maria estaba para la fecha del

5 28 de junio. Pero inmigraci6n liber6 a Maria el 27 de junio y Maria me llam6 porque los agentes

6 la dejaron en un McDonald's y ella no tenia a donde it ni dormir. Ella tuvo que buscar a alguien

7 que la alojara una noche y ahora esta en camino hacia Washington D.C.

8

16. El 28 de junio de 2018, habld con la trabajadora social quien me dijo que

9 tendremos que empezar el proceso de y que Maria tendra que llenar la aplicaci6n y pedir a los

10 ninos porque ya sali6 de detenci6n de inmigraci6n.

11

17. Estoy preocupado que ahora tendremos que empezar de nuevo el proceso para

12 reunir a los ninos de Maria con mi familia. Todos en mi casa, incluyendo mi mama de 78 anos

13 de edad, tendran que someter huellas, registro policial, e identificaci6n, y tendremos que

14 completar un nuevo formulario. Debido a la edad de mi mama, es dificil tomarle las huellas, y

15 oficiales de inmigraci6n me dijeron anteriormente que ella no tendria que someterse a las huellas

16 de nuevo. Tambidn me informaron que Maria tendra que tomarse las huellas y tendra que

17 presentar toda la documentaci6n. Estoy preocupado de que Maria no pueda producir el papeleo

18 necesano para poder reunirse con sus dos hijos. Maria no tiene pasaporte, y todo to que tiene es

19 to tarjeta de identificaci6n de El Salvador.

20

18. Todo este proceso ha sido muy dificil para mi familia:

21

a. Al principio cuando hablaba con M., el nitro de 7 anos, dl estaba muy

22 platicador y estaba emocionado porque la trabajadora social le dijo que saldria en una semana

23 Cuando el tiempo cuando M. esperaba salir lleg6 y nada pas6, dl se escuchaba depresivo, nc

24 decfa mucho y querfa Horan Me pregunt6 por qud no he venido por dl todavia. La trabajadon

25 social me dijo que M. estaba depresivo y me pidi6 palabras para animarlo. El 28 de junio habl(

26 1 con dl y esta contento porque piensa que pronto va a reunirse con su mama. Estoy mas

I preocupado por la salud mental de M. cuando se entere que tendremos que empezar el proceso

2 de nuevo y que no va a salir pronto.

3

b. Porque solo puedo hablar por tel6fono y N. es muy pequeno no he podido

4 hablar con el. M. me dijo que N. llora todo el tiempo, y el 6nico momento en que los dos ninos

5 se ven es en la noche. M. dijo que dejan que N. se quede con M. por la noche porque es to unico

6 que hard que N. deje de llorar

7

C. Cuando hablo con Maria ella me pregunta que esta pasando con los ninos

8 y se queda sin palabras cuando le digo que todavia estoy esperando la aprobaci6n. Ella Mora. 9 Ella solamente ha podido hablar con los ninos pocas veces.

10

d. La mds afectada por todo esto es mi mamd. Ella crio a Maria despu6s que

11 su mamd muri6 cuando Maria tenia 8 meses de edad. Al principio, yo no querfa decirle a mi

12 mamd to que estaba pasando porque ella tiene 78 anos de edad y estaba preocupado que si le

13 decfa se iba a poner mal de salud. Yo solo le dije que Maria y los ninos habian cruzado la

14 frontera, pero estaban detenidos. Despues de ver las noticias, mi mama exigi6 que le dijera que 15 estaba pasando. Mi mama se puso anal de salud cuando le dije que los ninos habian sido

16 separados de Maria. Desde que mi mama se enter6 de la separaci6n familiar ha tenido un dolor 17 de cabeza intenso y yo tuve que llevarla al doctor. Estoy muy preocupado por la salud de mi 18 mamd. Para Maria, la separaci6n de sus ninos repite la historia de cuando ella perdi6 a su mama.

19

e. Por mi parte, este proceso ha sido muy depresivo y fiustrante. Cuando al

20 fin pensaba que me iban a dar los ninos me dicen que siempre no. Tambi6n he tenido que 21 descansar de mi trabajo para hacer todo to que me han pedido que haga.

Ofidna de Reubicacio'n de Refugiados

De lam y afirmo, bajo pena de perjurio, que soy el patrocinador propuesto para et menor y que mi Solief ud de raunftrcaddn familiar y los documentos usados Como respaldo a la solicitud funcionan Como evident is de que tengo la plena intenct6n de proporclonarle cuidado at menor
que pretendo patrocinar. Asimismo, no me presento Como patrocinador para no tener a un menor a mi cuidado y lueaa transferir ese menor a otra persona, en incumplimleinto de la poli4ca
de la Oficina de Reubicad6n de Refugiados (Office of Refugee Resettlement, ORR) y las leyes
federates.
Solo puedo transfedr a un menor al cuidado de otra persona en las siguientes situaciones:
(1) a los padres biol6gicos del menor, en caso de que al hacerlo no exponga al nino a un
peligro inmediato y que no haya una finalizaci6n de los derechos parentaies;
(2) en el caso de que no pueda o no desee continuar el patrocinlo debido a una difrcultad inesperada o en el caso de que deje inminentemente los Estados Unidos, transferire

Comprendo que la conspiraci6n o la cooperacio'n en la comisio'n de cualquiera de los siguientes actos constituye un delito:
(1) ingresar o intentar ingreesar a un extranjero a los Estados Unidos por un lugar que no sea el puerto de entrada designado u otro lugar designado por el Departamento de
Seguridad National (Department of Homeland Security, DHS);

(4) incentivar o inducir a un extranjero para que venga a los Estados Unidos si su residenda es o sera una violacion a la ley.

Request for a Child Protection Register (CPR) Check

The purpose of the Child Protection Register is to protect children and to ensure their safety by maintaining an index of perpetrators of child abuse and neglect in the District of Columbia. This confidential index includes the names of individuals with substantiated and/or inconclusive findings from the investigative reports of the Child Protective Services Unit of the Child and Family Services Agency. Authorized individuals may request background checks to establish whether an individual has a record of substantiated abuse or neglect of a child that occurred in the District of Columbia.

► To request a local police clearance for the District of Columbia, please visit https://mpdc.dc.gov/node/187552. / For information about the Sex Offender Registry, visit: https://mpdc.dc.gov/service/sex-offender-registry. ► If you are making a request on behalf of a state child welfare agency outside of the District of Columbia and need
the history of a family previously living in the District of Columbia, you may call 202-671-SAFE. ► For other questions, call the CPR Unit at 202-727-8885 between 8:30 am and 4:30 pm Monday through Friday.

s Do not complete an old version of the form; get the latest form at https://cfsa.dc.gov/service/bacl<ground-checl<s. s Mail or deliver original application (no photocopies); no faxed, emailed, or scanned applications accepted.
Part I s Schools (other than DCPS), child care facilities, private foster care agencies, and other private, community-based organizations should select "Non-Government Organization" as the Requestor Type. s CPR check results are not transferrable and cannot be shared from one agency or employer to another.

Part III s An individual must sign the form to provide consent for CFSA to release information to an authorized requestor. s The form must be signed in blue ink; electronic signatures are not permitted. s An employment request allows access to substantiated reports of child maltreatment, to chief executive officers or directors of day care centers, schools, or any public or private organization working directly with children, for the purpose of making employment decisions.

Part V s Self-check applications must be submitted in person, not by mail. s Individuals requesting a self-check and CFSA resource parents and kin caregivers must present one non-expired, government-issued, photo identification: e.g., driver's license, state identification card, passport, "green card". s Results of CPR self-checks may not be used for employment purposes.

Defendants.

14 I, Emary C. Aronson, declare as follows:
15 1. I am over the age of eighteen and have personal knowledge of all the facts stated
16 herein.
17 2. I am Chief Program Officer for Robin Hood. I oversee Robin Hood’s grant-
18 making efforts to support nonprofit and social services in New York City. I have been employed
19 by Robin Hood since 1999.
20 3. Robin Hood is one of New York City’s largest poverty-fighting organizations.
21 Since its founding in 1988, Robin Hood has raised more than $2.5 billion in dollars, goods and
22 services to provide for hundreds of the most effective early childhood development programs,
23 schools, legal services nonprofits, healthcare clinics, homeless shelters and other vital services
24 in our city. Robin Hood’s mission is to ensure that New York’s neediest children and families
25 have the tools they need to build better lives. Our work is based on a rigorous set of metrics that

1 measures the relationship between the cost of an intervention and the economic and social

2 benefits it produces for the individual being served.

3

4. Consistent with our mission is the belief that all children present in New York

4 City, regardless of nativity or immigration status, have the right to safety, to grow up in a

5 nurturing environment with their parent or guardian, to be educated, to enjoy their childhood,

6 and to receive due process in immigration proceedings.

7

5. Robin Hood invests more than $30 million annually to support programs that

8 promote early childhood development, including initiatives focused on the crucial first 1,000

9 days of life. More than 50 years of research demonstrates that the lack of nurturing care from a

10 parent or committed caregiver, social interaction, appropriate stimulation, and psychological

11 comfort lead to a number of deleterious impacts that have lifelong consequences for children1,2.

12 These include serious impairments to healthy development leading to cognitive delays and

13 emotional dysregulation. Moreover, adverse childhood experiences, including even the brief

14 separation of children from their parents, are directly correlated with increased risk of

15 depression, suicidality, long-term physical health problems, substance abuse disorders, and other

16 social ills3.

17

6. Robin Hood also invests more than $5 million annually in programs that provide

18 immigration legal services. In 2013, we launched Immigrant Justice Corps, the country’s first

19 legal fellowship program focused on immigration services. That program has now served more

20 than 40,000 immigrants in four states. In 2014, we also helped establish the ICARE Coalition,

1 which has provided legal counsel to nearly 1,500 Central American unaccompanied minors in

2 New York City. We make these investments because attaining legal status provides a long-term

3 pathway out of poverty for immigrants in our city. Data from the Transactional Records Access

4 Clearinghouse at Syracuse University demonstrate that legal representation in immigration

5 proceedings increases the probability of a grant of legal status by at least 400 percent. However,

6 the federal government does not appoint counsel in immigration proceedings, thereby

7 endangering immigrant children’s right to due process, diminishing the likelihood they will

8 attain legal status and permanent work authorization, and constraining their ability to contribute

9 to our society and our economy into adulthood.

10

7. Robin Hood funds more than 200 nonprofit organizations every year. Through

11 our work, we have an intimate knowledge of the impact that shifts in federal policy can have on

12 local nonprofit operations. Without clear planning, communications, and transparent data

13 sharing in the implementation of new policies at the federal level, local social services are

14 severely disrupted. Nonprofit executives, attorneys, social workers and clinicians can be pulled

15 away from serving their regular clients to coordinate and respond to emergency needs.

16

8. We have learned that at least 300 children who were forcibly separated from their

17 parents are currently in New York City as a result of the “zero-tolerance policy.” We have been

18 in contact with more than two dozen agencies involved in mounting a local emergency response

19 to the situation. This outreach has included federal officials, state and local government

20 agencies, foster care agencies caring for these children, nonprofit legal services providers,

21 experts on the health and mental health of young children, and national and local philanthropic

22 organizations.

23

9. We know that organizations in New York City involved in this effort are

24 operating at the highest levels of professionalism and care for these vulnerable children.

25 However, the current situation resulting from the “zero-tolerance policy” has demanded a far

26 greater volume and type of service than historically they have been funded to provide. We have

1 learned that these children, in being separated from their parents, have experienced severe

2 trauma, compounded as they have faced difficulty in contacting or being reunited with their

3 parents or caregivers. Nonprofit legal services providers do not have sufficient staffing or space

4 to provide counsel to all those in need and are having to quickly gain new expertise to be able to

5 serve children who are pre-verbal. Translation services are also lacking, particularly for those

6 who children speak indigenous Central American languages. Immigrant children are now

7 spending twice as long in foster care as they have historically, as potential sponsor families are

8 reluctant to come forward due to increased immigration enforcement activities nationwide. As

9 a result, local governments and philanthropic institutions will likely need to divert millions of

10 dollars to ensure an effective and humane response to the situation on the ground.

11

10. We firmly believe that preserving the rights of asylum seekers, including young

12 children, as already enshrined in our laws, is vital to the fair administration of justice, to the

13 alleviation of poverty, and to our country’s economic prosperity.

14

11. The “zero-tolerance policy” instituted at our border, which directly led to the

15 separation of children and parents, has caused irreparable social and emotional trauma to the

16 hundreds of children now in our city as well as to their families detained across the country. This

17 is not a political issue. This policy has denied them and their families their fundamental right to

18 due process, overburdened local nonprofit services providers, and increased the likelihood that

19 these vulnerable children will live their lives in poverty.

1 4. I received a Ph.D. in political science at the end of the 2010-2011 academic year.
2 I was a post-doctoral research fellow during the 2011-2012 academic year. I joined the political
3 science department at UCSD during the 2012-2013 academic year. I served as an advisor to the
4 White House Initiative on Asian Americans and Pacific Islanders (WHIAAPI), where I worked
5 on the immigration portfolio, during the 2015-2016 academic year. I was promoted to the rank
6 of Associate Professor with tenure at UCSD during the 2016-2017 academic year.
7 5. I have attached a true and complete copy of my curriculum vitae as Exhibit A to
8 this Declaration.
9 6. Data on the monthly number of U.S. Border Patrol apprehensions of family units
10 at the Southwest border show that recent policies intended to deter families from attempting to
11 enter the U.S. without authorization have not had their desired deterrent effects. The data show
12 that the expanded use of family detention is not statistically significantly related to decreases in
13 the monthly number of U.S. Border Patrol apprehensions of family units at the Southwest border.
14 The data also show that the use of family separation is not statistically significantly related to
15 decreases in the monthly number of U.S. Border Patrol apprehensions of family units at the
16 Southwest border; instead, U.S. Border Patrol apprehensions of family units at the Southwest
17 border have increased following the current administration’s “zero tolerance” pilot. Moreover,
18 the data show that U.S. Border Patrol apprehensions of family units at the Southwest border have
19 followed seasonal trends, wherein the monthly number of apprehensions increases beginning
20 late Winter (February and March) and continues to increase through Spring (April, May, and
21 June) before declining at the start Summer (July).
22 7. In my first set of analyses, I evaluate changes over time in the monthly number
23 of U.S. Border Patrol apprehensions of family units at the Southwest border from October 2012

1 data from U.S. Customs and Border Protection on the monthly number of U.S. Border Patrol
2 apprehensions of family units at the Southwest border.
3 8. The method used to analyze these data is interrupted times series analysis
4 (ITSA).2 ITSA is a quasi-experimental research design, meaning a research design that evaluates
5 causal effects using observational data, that is, data that do not come from experimental research
6 that makes use of random assignment to control and treatment conditions. ITSA is used to
7 evaluate trends before, immediately following, and during the period after an intervention, such
8 as a policy change. ITSA estimates three main parameters: ß1 is the slope or trajectory of the
9 outcome variable before the start of the policy change; ß2 is the change in the level of the outcome
10 variable in the period immediately following the start of the policy change; and ß3 is the effect of
11 the policy change over time.
12 9. In response to the increase in the number of arrivals of Central American families
13 and unaccompanied children at the Southwest border in 2014, the Karnes County Residential
14 Center was converted from a civil detention facility to a family detention facility in July 2014.3
15 During this time, families were also detained at a temporary facility in Artesia, New Mexico
16 before the South Texas Family Residential Center in Dilley, Texas opened in December 2014.
17 The conversion of the Karnes County Residential Center and the opening of the South Texas
18 Family Residential Center represented major shifts, as the use of family detention had been
19 largely abandoned by the Obama administration prior to 2014.4 When delivering remarks at the

1 opening of the South Texas Family Residential Center, then Secretary Jeh Johnson stated, “I
2 believe this is an effective deterrent.”5
3 10. Using ITSA, I analyze the potential deterrent effect of the expanded use of family
4 detention on the monthly number of U.S. Border Patrol apprehensions of family units at the
5 Southwest border.
6 11. The results are reported in Table 1 below.6 Model 1 estimates the relationship
7 between the expanded use of family detention, measured by the conversion of the Karnes County
8 Residential Center in July 2014 (ß2) and each subsequent month thereafter (ß3), and the monthly
9 number of U.S. Border Patrol apprehensions of family units at the Southwest border. If the
10 expanded use of family detention has a deterrent effect, we would expect ß2 and ß3 to be negative
11 and statistically significant, meaning the monthly number of U.S. Border Patrol apprehensions
12 of family units at the Southwest border decreases with the expanded use of family detention.
13 12. In Model 1, the ß1 coefficient is positive and statistically significant, which
14 affirms that the monthly number of U.S. Border Patrol apprehensions of family units at the
15 Southwest border was increasing before July 2014. However, both the ß2 and ß3 coefficients are
16 statistically insignificant, which suggests that the expanded use of family detention is not
17 statistically significantly related to an immediate decrease or longer-term decreases in the
18 monthly number of U.S. Border Patrol apprehensions of family units at the Southwest border.
19 Otherwise put, the data do not provide evidence to suggest that family detention has a deterrent
20 effect, as the monthly number of U.S. Border Patrol apprehensions of family units at the
21 Southwest border was increasing before July 2014, and apprehensions did not decrease in a
22 statistically significant way after July 2014.

13. Moreover, eight additional models were run specifying eight different pseudo-

1 children. As it relates to family units, in prosecuting all persons caught attempting to enter the
2 U.S. without authorization, children have been separated from their parents. Whereas the Obama
3 administration used family detention in response to Central American families and
4 unaccompanied children arriving at the Southwest border, the Trump administration has used
5 family separation. In March 2017, in response to the question of whether the Trump
6 administration was going to separate children from their parents, current White House Chief of
7 Staff and then Department of Homeland Security Secretary John F. Kelly stated, “Yes, I am
8 considering, in order to deter more movement along this terribly dangerous network [migrating
9 from Central America through Mexico to the U.S.], I am considering exactly that.”10 As recently
10 as June 2018, Attorney General Jeff Sessions reiterated the administration’s belief in the
11 deterrent effect of family separation stating, “We cannot and will not encourage people to bring
12 their children or other children to the country unlawfully by giving them immunity in the
13 process.”11
14 15. Using ITSA, I analyze the deterrent effect of family separation on the monthly
15 number of U.S. Border Patrol apprehensions of family units at the Southwest border.
16 16. The results are reported in Table 2 below.12 Model 2 estimates the relationship
17 between the use of family separation, measured by the beginning of the zero tolerance pilot in
18 July 2017 (ß4) and each subsequent month thereafter (ß5), and the monthly number of U.S.
19 Border Patrol apprehensions of family units at the Southwest border while controlling for the
20 expanded use of family detention in July 2014.

1 17. In Model 2, the ß1 coefficient remains positive and statistically significant, again

2 affirming that the monthly number of U.S. Border Patrol apprehensions of family units at the

3 Southwest border was increasing before July 2014. Both the ß2 and ß3 coefficients remain

4 statistically insignificant, also affirming the results in Model 1. The ß4 coefficient is statistically

5 insignificant, which suggests that family separation is not statistically significantly related to an

6 immediate decrease in the monthly number of U.S. Border Patrol apprehensions of family units

7 at the Southwest border. Unexpectedly, the ß5 coefficient is positive and highly statistically

8 significant, which means that instead of a deterrent effect, the monthly number of U.S. Border

9 Patrol apprehensions of family units at the Southwest border has increased significantly after

10 July 2017. Otherwise put, the data do not provide evidence to suggest that family separation has

11 a deterrent effect, as the monthly number of U.S. Border Patrol apprehensions of family units at

12 the Southwest border has increased after July 2017, not decreased.

1 need time to take effect. The pseudo-interventions analyzed include the months during the zero
2 tolerance pilot after July 2017 (August 2017 to November 2017), as well as the three months
3 after the zero tolerance pilot.13 These models produce qualitatively similar results, wherein
4 instead of a deterrent effect, the monthly number of U.S. Border Patrol apprehensions of family
5 units at the Southwest border has increased significantly after the zero tolerance pilot, not
6 decreased.
7 19. In my last set of analyses, I turn to the more rigorous Autoregressive Integrated
8 Moving Average (ARIMA) interrupted time series method. ARIMA is the primary method of
9 analyzing quasi-experimental time series data. The ARIMA interrupted time series method
10 removes time trends (the “noise”) in order to isolate the impact of an intervention, such as a
11 policy change (the “signal”). ARIMA modeling begins by identifying and removing noise,
12 meaning the extent to which the data in a time series can be accurately predicted by time itself
13 (for example, addressing the extent to which the number of U.S. Border Patrol apprehensions of
14 family units at the Southwest border in one month can be accurately predicted by the number of
15 apprehensions during the previous month [autocorrelation] or the extent to which the number of
16 U.S. Border Patrol apprehensions of family units at the Southwest border in one month can be
17 accurately predicted by the number of apprehensions during the same month in a previous year
18 [seasonality]). After identifying and removing noise, this allows us to evaluate the extent to
19 which an intervention has an effect on our outcome of interest that is independent from
20 underlying time trends. Otherwise put, this allows us to evaluate whether policy changes such as
21 the expanded use of family detention or the use of family separation more accurately predict the
22 monthly number of U.S. Border Patrol apprehensions of family units at the Southwest border
23 than seasonal patterns or other time trends.

13 These models specify the intervention as August 2017, or September 2017, or October 2017, or November 2017, or December 2017, or January 2018, or February 2018.

1 20. ARIMA modeling is important for our purposes here given the data on the
2 monthly number of U.S. Border Patrol apprehensions of family units at the Southwest border
3 exhibit seasonal trends. The figure below is a stacked line graph that shows the cumulative
4 number of U.S. Border Patrol apprehensions of family units at the Southwest border by month
5 from 2012 to 2017.14 As the figure shows, a strong seasonal trend emerges in 2014, wherein the
6 monthly number of U.S. Border Patrol apprehensions of family units at the Southwest border
7 increases beginning late-Winter (February and March) and continues to increase through Spring
8 (April, May, and June) before declining at the start Summer (July). The figure also shows that a
9 second peak may be emerging in Fall (October, November, December), however, it is too soon
10 to tell if this trend will hold given 2017 was the first year in the time series that we saw large
11 numbers of U.S. Border Patrol apprehensions of family units during these months.

2 3 shows that after identifying and removing time trends,15 there is no statistically significant

3 relationship between the expanded use of family detention, measured by the conversion of the

4 Karnes County Residential Center in July 2014, and the monthly number of U.S. Border Patrol

7 separations, measured by the beginning of the zero tolerance pilot in July 2017, and the monthly

8 number of U.S. Border Patrol apprehensions of family units at the Southwest border. Model 5,

Conclusion

17

22. Altogether, data on the monthly number of U.S. Border Patrol apprehensions of

18

family units at the Southwest border shows that recent policies intended to deter families from

19

attempting to enter the U.S. without authorization have not had their desired deterrent effects.

20 • As the data show, the expanded use of family detention is not statistically

21

significantly related to decreases in the monthly number of U.S. Border Patrol

22

apprehensions of family units at the Southwest border. This result is robust when

23

24
15 The dependent variable in Model 3 is the first order difference of the natural log of the monthly

25

number of U.S. Border Patrol apprehensions of family units at the Southwest border. 16 The dependent variable in Model 4 is also the first order difference of the natural log of the monthly

26

number of U.S. Border Patrol apprehensions of family units at the Southwest border. 17 These results are also robust when testing the range of pseudo-interventions described above.

2 analysis.
3 • As the data also show, the use of family separation is not statistically significantly
4 related to decreases in the monthly number of U.S. Border Patrol apprehensions of
5 family units at the Southwest border; instead, U.S. Border Patrol apprehensions of
6 family units at the Southwest border have increased following the zero tolerance
7 pilot. This result is robust when testing seven pseudo-interventions and when using
8 ARIMA interrupted time series analysis.
9 • Moreover, the data show that U.S. Border Patrol apprehensions of family units at the
10 Southwest border has followed seasonal trends, wherein the monthly number of
11 apprehensions increases beginning late Winter (February and March) and continues
12 to increase through Spring (April, May, and June) before declining at the start
13 Summer (July).

15 States of America that the foregoing is true and correct.

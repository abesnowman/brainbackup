National Security A family was separated at the border, and this distraught father took his own life
by Nick Miroff June 9 Email the author A Honduran father separated from his wife and child suffered a breakdown at a Texas jail and killed himself in a padded cell last month, according to Border Patrol agents and an incident report filed by sheriff’s deputies. The death of Marco Antonio Muñoz, 39, has not been publicly disclosed by the Department of Homeland Security, and it did not appear in any local news accounts. But according to a copy of a sheriff’s department report obtained by The Washington Post, Muñoz was found on the floor of his cell May 13 in a pool of blood with an item of clothing twisted around his neck. Starr County sheriff’s deputies recorded the incident as a “suicide in custody.” Muñoz’s death occurred not long after the Trump administration began implementing its “zero-tolerance” crackdown on illegal migration, measures that include separating parents from their children and the threat of criminal prosecution for anyone who enters the United States unlawfully. [Trump’s ‘zero tolerance’ at the border is causing child shelters to fill up fast]
Much of the controversy generated by the approach has centered on its potentially traumatic impact for migrant children, but the government has said little about how it handles parents who become mentally unstable or violent after authorities split up their families. Officials at U.S. Customs and Border Protection in Washington, which oversees border enforcement, had no immediate comment on Muñoz’s death nor the whereabouts of his wife and child. Starr County authorities refused to provide a copy of Muñoz’s autopsy report and did not respond to several phone messages requesting more information about the cause of death. An official at the Embassy of Honduras in Washington, Assunta Garcia, said the nation’s ambassador was the only person authorized to comment on Muñoz’s death. But Garcia said he was too busy attending to a visit from President Juan Orlando Hernández. According to Border Patrol agents with detailed knowledge of what occurred, Muñoz crossed the Rio Grande with his wife and 3-year-old son on May 12 near the tiny town of Granjeno, Tex. The area is a popular crossing point for Central American families and teenagers who turn themselves in to apply for asylum in the United States.
Soon after Muñoz and his family were taken into custody, they arrived at a processing station in nearby McAllen and said they wanted to apply for asylum. Border Patrol agents told the family they would be separated. That’s when Muñoz “lost it,” according to one agent, speaking on the condition of anonymity to discuss the incident. “The guy lost his s---,” the agent said. “They had to use physical force to take the child out of his hands.” Muñoz was placed in a chain-link detention cell, but he began punching the metal and shaking it violently, agents said. [Illegal border crossings remained high in May despite Trump’s crackdown] Though Muñoz did not attempt to assault Border Patrol staff, he was at that point considered to be “pre-assault” because he was so agitated. As one agent described it, Muñoz “had the look of a guy at a bar who wanted to fight someone.” “We had to get him out,” the agent said. “Those cells are about as secure as a dog kennel. He could have hurt someone.” Unruly detainees typically are taken to local jails, where they can be placed in more secure settings or isolation cells, known as administrative segregation. Border Patrol agents found a vacant cell for Muñoz 40 miles away at

the Starr County Jail in Rio Grande City. When they attempted to place Muñoz in the van, he tried to run away and had to be captured and restrained. “He yelled and kicked at the windows on the ride to the jail,” an agent said. Shackled and handcuffed, Muñoz attempted to escape again upon arrival and once more had to be restrained. According to the sheriff’s department report, Muñoz was booked into the jail at 9:40 p.m. He remained combative and was placed in a padded isolation cell, it says. Guards said they checked on Muñoz every 30 minutes and observed him praying in a corner of his cell the following morning. A guard who walked by the cell at 9:50 a.m. said he noticed Muñoz lying in the center of the floor, unresponsive and without a pulse. The guard “noticed a small pool of blood by his nose” and “a piece of clothing twisted around his neck which was tied to the drainage location in the center of the cell,” according to the incident report filed by the sheriff’s department that morning. Paramedics found Muñoz dead, his electrocardiogram showing a “flat line,” according to the report. The sheriff’s department said it attempted to contact Honduran authorities who could reclaim Muñoz’s body, but they received no answer at a consulate. Muñoz’s wife and son were later released from Border Patrol custody, according to one agent. Another agent familiar with what happened said he couldn’t understand why Muñoz “would choose to separate himself from his family forever” by taking his own life. Homeland Security officials say they are doing more to explain the separation process to parents and have set up a special hotline to help them locate their children after several reports of migrants being sent back to Central America while their children remain in U.S. foster care thousands of miles away.

The Fix Analysis The Trump administration changed its story on family separation no fewer than 14 times before ending the policy
by JM Rieger June 20 Email the author First it was a deterrent. Then it wasn’t. It was a new Justice Department policy. Then it wasn’t. The Trump administration was simply following the law. Then it said separations weren’t required by law. It could not be reversed by executive order. Then it was. President Trump’s political gambit to force an immigration bill through Congress backfired Wednesday amid a series of wildly contradictory statements — which you can see for yourself in the video above — from a White House that has been without a communications director since Hope Hicks left in March. As outrage grew over Trump’s “zero tolerance” policy on migrant family separations, White House officials could not even agree on what was happening at the southern border. “This administration did not create a policy of separating families at the border,” Homeland Security Secretary Kirstjen Nielsen said Monday. On Tuesday, Marc Short, the White House director of legislative affairs, said it was indeed a policy. “This is not a policy that people are excited about,” he said.
When a reporter asked Nielsen on Monday whether the policy was being used as a deterrent, she called the question “offensive.” Hours later, Attorney General Jeff Sessions told Fox News Channel’s Laura Ingraham that yes, the policy was meant to send a “message” to immigrants crossing the border illegally. For days, Trump, Sessions and Nielsen insisted that family separation was required by law. Then White House counselor Kellyanne Conway told CNN that “nobody said” the law mandated family separation. When asked about the policy in May, Nielsen testified there was “training information” for officials tasked with separating families. Then in June, Manuel Padilla Jr., Border Patrol chief for the Rio Grande Valley, told reporters that no “separation process” existed. In blaming Congress for White House policy Tuesday, Short said a shortage of congressional funding for additional immigration judges was causing the overflow at detention facilities. Two hours later, Trump said: “I don't want judges. I want border security.” Trump threatened that he would not sign a “moderate” House Republican immigration bill Friday. Hours later, the White House said Trump did, in fact, support the “moderate” bill. And when reporters asked Trump on Friday why he would not reverse his two-month-old policy via executive order, Trump shot back, “You can’t do it through an executive order.” Five days later, Trump contradicted himself again.

Editor's note: This post contains language some may find offensive. NPR's Southwest correspondent John Burnett speaks with White House chief of staff John Kelly. Here's a partial transcript of their conversation, which has been edited for clarity. Burnett started by talking with Kelly about how much time he spends with President Trump:

John Kelly: I do spend a huge amount of time with him. Now, less so today. When I when I got here there was a lot of work to be done organizational work to be done. So I spent every minute with him. But that was to train the staff as to how to interact with the president because it was that needed to be done and to organize how people interact with the president in the Oval Office.
John Burnett: So how many hours a day would you figure?
I don't know, seven or eight.
Wow, OK.
Five, six, seven, eight.
What do you do to start your day?
The minute I start, I start. I mean it's work. I leave the house. We live, we moved to a house in Manassas, which was the house that we would live in I'd never work another day when I retired from the Marine Corps. So it's about a 40-minute drive. I get driven in by the Secret Service. I get my fair amount of threats. But anyway.
So when I get in the car at 5:30 I have to read, basically cover-to-cover, The New York Times, The Washington Post, the CNN website, the FOX News website, Politico and a website I never read before until I got this job: Breitbart. So, you know, to get that end of the political spectrum. So that's from 5:30 and I get home at 8, 8:30 or later.

OK. What do you what do you drink when you get home? Wine usually. Unless my wife's in California, which she is now, and you know I hit the hard stuff.

What kind of wine?
Cheap red wine.
So what's harder — commanding Marines in a combat zone in Iraq or bringing order to the Trump White House?
Working in the White House is the hardest thing I've ever done in my life, bar none.
Talk about that.
Well, first, with all due respect to people like yourselves, I was not ready for the press that covers a White House. All of my time, and you remember it a little bit, I think, we were pretty good to you guys. We had a good team effort going in the field. When I was working in the Pentagon at a higher level, senior level the Pentagon press corps were really good to work with. I mean they, they seldom wrote or did the story you wanted to read, naturally, but they were really professional in trying to get the accurate aspect of every story. It wasn't personal. It was pretty professional. And I still call some of them ... good acquaintances. This is vastly different. This is — it's personal, it's vicious. ...
I did my first off the record — that was immediately violated. But after about six weeks in a job one of the reporters said to me, "Look you were our worst nightmare. This place was a clown show before you showed up. We didn't think this president would last a year [or] 18 months. Now that you're here, there's order to the place. The leaks all but went away. So, sorry but you got to go." So here I am, sitting, still here.
With your background valuing chain of command and military discipline, do you feel like you've brought some discipline and integrity to this inner circle?
They overstate that, press covers that a lot. Again, I don't mean to be too hard on the press but they — I know everything. Right? And so when I read the press accounts of what's going on here, I say, "gee, how could they have gotten that that wrong?" So I

think the press, and maybe it's because only certain people talk and those people maybe leak or are sources — and maybe those people aren't as honorable as they should be. But when I read what they write, I think to myself they may have had some low-level source and that's — and to write a story like that — whatever "that" is for a major newspaper like the Post or the Times -- to base it on almost rumor strikes me as being a little bit — not the way to do business.
There's been some reporting about some derogatory words that you use to describe the president. I know you've denied it. How would you describe your relationship with Donald Trump?
The president and I have a very close relationship. I've always — my view is to speak truth to power. I always give my opinion, on everything. Sometimes — he always listens. Sometimes he takes the opinion, sometimes he doesn't. The good thing about the president is he does listen to people and when I — the organization I brought to the place is whatever the topic is, generally speaking, we will have a group in there of very — a spectrum. So if it's taxes, you'll have someone who thinks you know very liberally about taxes and someone who's on the arch-conservative side and then a sprinkling of everyone in the middle. And then there's a discussion and generally if there's a decision to be made then I help execute that. So we have a very close relationship in the sense of – I'm his chief of staff and I tell him what I think is always the truth is and whether he goes along with my recommendations is another story.
How would you describe his intellect?
Very smart – a very, very smart guy. I mean a super smart guy. But I think it wouldn't surprise you to know he's very strong. He's very strong in terms of trade, taxes, business and he's a quick study on everything else. He's a pretty bright guy.
So do you have any regrets about taking this job nine months ago? You know, there have been reports that you're considering leaving.

First of all, I didn't get a vote. Took $30,000 a year cut to take this job from what I was doing at DHS and I say that only because I'm one of the probably the few people around here that isn't really rich, at my age anyways. You know, the sense of duty. It was clear from my perch at DHS that the White House was less organized than our president deserved. So when he said, "I really need you to come down, what do you say?" I came down.
You seriously considered leaving?
No. I mean there's times of great frustration, mostly because of the stories I've read about myself or others that I think the world of which is just about everyone that works at the complex. You wonder if it's worth it to be subjected to that. But then I grow up and suck it up.
Do the president's inaccurate statements; everything from the number of people he believes voted illegally, to the size of the inauguration crowd, or to the payments to the lawyer regarding Stormy Daniels — do inaccurate statements make your job harder?
You know, I'm not so sure they're inaccurate. I wasn't here for the for the first two examples. One of the things we've all done here we have to do here, John, in terms of these outside accusations — we've had to really build a firewall between the White House staff that works for the president of the United States and the personal legal staff that works for Donald Trump. And that comes together in one individual here that works at the White House. But, like, Sarah Sanders when she's asked a question and she says, "I don't know, ask Rudy Giuliani," she's not punting it. She... we all work very hard not to know the issues related to Donald J. Trump. We work very, very hard to master the issues related to the president of United States.
Are there things that you wish you personally had done differently in this job?
In retrospect, I wish I had been here from Day 1.

Well because that's six months, I think in some cases in terms of staffing or serving the president that first six months was pretty chaotic and there were people — some people hired that maybe shouldn't have hired some people that were — it was just, I wish I'd been here from the beginning because I could have brought the organization from, you know, from Day 1 as opposed to — Now it's not that things were a disaster for that six months, but I believe they could have been better.
The president keeps calling the Russian investigation a witch hunt, do you do you think it is? Do you think it's a witch hunt against the president?
From what I read in the newspaper, because I have no knowledge — as I say, I've built a firewall. From what I read and observe in the news media — something that has gone on this long without any real meat on the bone, it suggests to me that there is nothing there, relative to our president.
Is there a cloud hanging over this White House?
Well yeah, you know, there may not be a cloud but certainly the president is you know somewhat embarrassed, frankly. When world leaders come in - it's kind of like you know Bibi Netanyahu is here — who's under investigation himself — and it's like, you know, you walk in and you know the first couple of minutes of every conversation might revolve around that kind of thing.
What kind of thing?
Well, it's a distraction.
The Russia investigation?
Or whatever. It's just a distraction for him. He has, you know, he has said this himself in the press or publicly that he really wants to reach out and have a good relationship with say Russia in the same way the head does with Xi from China. And hopefully Kim

from North Korea. But he's but he's a little hesitant to do that right now because of what you say is a cloud.
Regarding the Iran nuclear deal. You served as special assistant to the Supreme Allied Commander in Europe and at U.S. Southern Command with responsibility over Latin America. You understand the importance of working with U.S. allies. Are you concerned we're going to lose our trust because of pulling out of the Iran deal?
I don't think so. I mean it was a horrible deal. The best deal someone thought they could get. Horrible deal.
What's Step 2 now that we pulled out? What is the new deal?
Re-establishing, not re-establishing, but ensuring that a country that has been has been very unreliable in their claims about not ever having a nuclear program etc. doesn't get a nuclear program. And in a country that is developing [intercontinental ballistic missiles] ... the rational man and woman can't quite understand why he'd need an ICBM that could reach Europe or the United States. It's the same kind of point that he's making to Kim — why do you need nuclear weapons? Why do you need an ICBM that can hit the United States? We have no intention of invading you. Work this thing out with your brothers and sisters to the south. So, the Europeans are decided to stay in. And I think we'll help them improve on the [agreement] that they have with Iran.
Regarding the upcoming summit with Kim. How can you be sure that he's not going to trick you? We've been down this road so many times before and there have been disappointments with that country.
Not sure, but this president's got his eyes wide open. There is, he really — believe me – the president really wants this to work. We talk fairly frequently about nuclear weapons and he's just astounded that the United States that the human race could have gotten itself into this dilemma with all of these nuclear weapons. As he says, to

help North Korea see the light, give up its nuclear program and its missile program would be a wonderful thing. But, as he said, hopefully it'll work out maybe it won't. But I don't think he'll fall for it in the same way. I know he won't fall for it in the same way that past presidents have - that get strung along, strung along, lift the sanctions, give them money and get nothing for it.
Finally, to immigration. You were only at DHS for about six months. But you had a consequential time there. Aggressive enforcement was begun right after the president came into office. Are you still interested in border security and immigration from your perch here?
Yeah, I mean it's not something I think about as much as when I was at DHS. But you know when I was at DHS, I certainly carried the same point of view and that is we have immigration laws. We have border protection laws that are simply ignored or have been ignored.
One of the things that we did at my first day at DHS we just said to the men and women of ICE and the men and women of CBP — Customs and Border Protection; just go to your job, and do it legally do it humanely. But go do your job. That, combined frankly, with Mr. Trump coming in — his campaign promises and whatnot — the immigration fell off dramatically. Mostly because people are not willing to take the chance of spending a huge amount of money to them – $6,000, $12,000, $15,000 — to have the traffickers get them to the United States.
And if you believe what Donald Trump was saying and he does believe it — quick return to where you came from. We have a serious problem internally. We have very, very, I'd say chaotic immigration laws that we have just got to change. I mean this is all on the United States Congress — they don't do. They have not done anything to address this. And I could give you example after example of laws.
In terms of the Deferred Action for Childhood Arrivals program, where are you putting your hopes now?

It's astounding to me, and it should be to the world — that the president from what he was saying during the campaign to what he agreed upon with the with the four pillars, to take 670,000 people who were covered under the Obama DACA program ... The second 670,000 of course were the ones that were going on under the Obama administration that for some reason didn't get around to registering which is very easily done.
I believe you said that they needed to get off their lazy asses and register.
I believe that's a quote. But for whatever reason they didn't get off their butts. The fact is that this president said, "throw them in there so," we get 1.8 million. That was earthshaking enough. And then a path to citizenship. I thought based on all of the rhetoric I was getting from the particularly the Democrats on the Hill both sides of the aisle both sides of the hill that they, I mean that was Nevada and they you know they tap that around and tossed it around.
What would you like to see happen legislatively right now?
Right now I would like to see legislatively the four pillars enacted. And I think those that did not grasp the four pillars and pass it, have let down 1.8 million DACA people — either full recipients or the ones that didn't get around to signing up and they're still in limbo. And this president wants to get them out of limbo and get them into heaven. But it is astounding to me with all of my interactions with the Hispanic Caucus, the Democratic Caucus, all of that that when this stuff was served up on a silver platter they did nothing.
And then in terms of temporary protected status, there was a report that you called acting DHS Secretary Elaine Duke and said, "I urge you to cancel that status for the Hondurans." Is that true?
It is not true. I called her because she was not making a decision and I said, "look, I don't care what you do."

Case 2:18-cv-00939-MJP Document 1-2 Filed 06/26/18 Page 43 of 380

So you think all the TPS status should be canceled for all the countries?
I think we should fold all of the TPS people that have been here for a considerable period of time and find a way for them to be [on] a path to citizenship. Use the Haitians as an example.
A path to citizenship rather than sent home?
Yeah. Well, they were there in a legal status under TPS, that's a big deal. They're under legal status. You take the Central Americans that have been here 20-plus years. I mean if you really start looking at them and saying, "OK you know you've been here 20 years. What have you done with your life?" Well, I've met an American guy and I have three children and I've worked and gotten a degree or I'm a brick mason or something like that. That's what I think we should do — for the ones that have been here for shorter periods of time, the whatever it was that gave them TPS status in the first place. If that is solved back in their home countries they should go home.
So did you disagree with the decision by your successor Secretary Nielsen that Salvadorans and Hondurans and Haitians who've been here a very long time should have been allowed a path to citizenship?
I did not talk to her about it. But let me go back to ... Duke, one more time. My phone call to her was I don't give a shit what you decide. Just make a decision. We were at the point we needed to make a decision on that particular group of people. She seemed to be incapable of making it. I just called and said I don't care what you do. Just do something. They stay or they go. ...
In fact, she was in the office here on her last day apologizing for however that story get out. But anyway.
I think by doing what she's done Secretary Nielsen once again is forcing the United States Congress to do something. I mean I can't tell you, John, the number of times in my hearings when they would ask me about why we're doing this so that what your

philosophy is on immigration or whatever. I just said look you make the laws. I execute the laws. I can't pick and choose what laws to enforce. I would be, I should be thrown out of the job if I do that. Just do your job. Fix the problem. Or as I said in some remarks just shut up and let us do our job.
The president sent National Guard troops to the border and said he's going to keep them there until the border wall is built. Do you think that Mr. Trump continues to put too much stock in a border wall as the answer to border security?
You know, physical barriers work. Mr. Trump ... two years before he became the president-elect was talking about barriers along the border. He acknowledged the fact way back then that this was not going to be a concrete wall from sea to shining sea. That there were places we didn't need a wall. Places that were just too rough and people didn't know the big bend section of Texas is an example. You don't need a wall there. You know the mountain goats can't get through.
There's other places particularly where you are close to cities on the U.S. side will you very definitely need a barrier ... along the California border cut illegal immigration by 97 percent. So those border crossings — San Ysidro I think is 100,000 people come in every day, legally Mexicans. Something like that. And let me say a very, very large number. And at the end of the day a very, very large number the same people go back home to Mexico. What did they do in the United States? They shop, they work. They bring their kids to school. You know Catholic schools or private schools. Bring them back. We want that kind of movement. What we don't want is illegal immigrants.
Are you in favor of this new move announced by the attorney general early this week that if you cross the border illegally even if you're a mother with your children [we're going] to arrest you? We're going to prosecute you, we're going to send your kids to a juvenile shelter?
The name of the game to a large degree. Let me step back and tell you that the vast majority of the people that move illegally into United States are not bad people.

They're not criminals. They're not MS-13. Some of them are not. But they're also not people that would easily assimilate into the United States into our modern society. They're overwhelmingly rural people in the countries they come from – fourth, fifth, sixth grade educations are kind of the norm. They don't speak English, obviously that's a big thing. They don't speak English. They don't integrate well, they don't have skills. They're not bad people. They're coming here for a reason. And I sympathize with the reason. But the laws are the laws. But a big name of the game is deterrence.
Family separation stands as a pretty tough deterrent.
It could be a tough deterrent — would be a tough deterrent. A much faster turnaround on asylum seekers.
Even though people say that's cruel and heartless to take a mother away from her children?
I wouldn't put it quite that way. The children will be taken care of — put into foster care or whatever. But the big point is they elected to come illegally into the United States and this is a technique that no one hopes will be used extensively or for very long.

U.S. Attorney General Jeff Sessions joined me this morning to discuss the Administration’s policies at the border vis-a-vis children, whether unaccompanied or with a parent:

06-05hhs-sessions
Transcript:
HH: I’m so pleased to welcome back to the Hugh Hewitt Show the Attorney General of the United States, Jeff Sessions. General Sessions, welcome back.
JS: Good morning, Hugh.
HH: Let me begin. Is it absolutely necessary, General, to separate parents from children when they are detained or apprehended at the border?
JS: Yes. What’s happening is we are having more people coming bringing children with them entering between the ports of entry, between the ports of entry illegally, and they’re not, you cannot give them immunity. That’s an offense. We believe every person that enters the country illegally like that should be prosecuted. And you can’t be giving immunity to people who bring children with them recklessly and improperly and illegally. They should never do that. And so those children are being well taken care of. Within 72 hours, they’re taken to the Health and Human Services to be sure they’re properly cared for. And those persons will have, the adults will be prosecuted like the law requires.
HH: I understand the prosecution part. But is it necessary to separate the children? Could they not be detained in facilities where at least mothers and infants could remain together?
JS: Well, most are not infants. Most are teenagers, although we do have a number of younger ones now, more than we’ve seen recently. And they are maintained in a very safe environment not by the law enforcement team at Homeland Security, but put with Health and Human Services. And they are kept close by, and if the person pleads guilty, they would be deported promptly, and they can take their children with them. And, but we do,

the Homeland Security can only keep these children for 72 hours before they go to Health and Human Services.
HH: But General, what I’m pressing on, because I’m disturbed by this. I don’t think children should be separated from biological parents at any age, but especially if they’re infants and toddlers. I think it’s traumatic and terribly difficult on the child. Is it absolutely necessary to do so? Can’t we have facilities where parents remain united with kids?
JS: Well, we can, we’d be glad to work at that, and actually, to keep them as close as possible, and then they’re deported. But the law requires us to keep children in a different facility than we do for adults. And every time somebody, Hugh, gets prosecuted in America for a crime, American citizens, and they go to jail, they’re separated from their children. We don’t want to do this at all. If people don’t want to be separated from their children, they should not bring them with them. We’ve got to get this message out. You’re not given immunity. You have to, you will be prosecuted if you bring, if you come illegally. And if you bring children, you’ll still be prosecuted.
HH: I understand the message.
JS: I’m saying the only thing we can do about this, and certainly, we prefer to keep the children close by. And if we have a prompt hearing, as we do in many cases, they go back home with their children.
HH: You know, I understand the deterrent, and I understand there are 2.7 million children in America with a parent who’s incarcerated and are separated. But if it’s possible to build detention facilities, because these people have not been adjudicated guilty, they’re under suspicion, could we not provide…I spent 17 years in Orange County working on children and families issues trying to keep people who fell into homelessness together with their children because of the impact on children, Mr. Attorney General. Surely, you’ll agree that’s a terrible thing for a child, isn’t it?
JS: Well, it is, but this is not like somebody getting ten years in jail. I mean, these are often within days. Now if they get into a prolonged asylum process, the children are then turned over to some sort of family that is to take care of them while the adult may be in trial. But basically, the adults are frequently getting bail, too, and be able to be with their children. So it’s not, it’s certainly not our goal to separate children, but I do think it’s clear, it’s legitimate to warn people who come to the country unlawfully bringing children with them that they can’t expect that they’ll always be kept together.
HH: I had the deputy secretary…
JS: We don’t have the capacity now to do it.

HH: All right, I had the deputy secretary of HHS on last week, and he explained to me how the 10,000 children in the care of the United States are cared for at more than 100-plus facilities. Have you, Mr. Attorney General, visited any of those facilities?
JS: I have not visited them. Those are within the ambit of the Homeland Security and the Health and Human Services. But I believe for the most part they’re well taken care of. They turn, but I’ve got to tell you, we have some problems like we don’t often know who it is that comes and picks them up. And sometimes, they’re illegally in the country also. Sometimes, we take them to places from the border to Denver, to Chicago, to Islip, New York. We transport them to the place they want to go. Many of the children are taken in that fashion. It’s really an amazing thing. We need to get this border under control. We need better, we’re going to see some new legislation through Congress, and we want to send a message to the world that if you want to come to America, make your application and wait your turn.
HH: Good message. Senator Merkley attempted to visit one of these facilities in Brownsville, Texas. He was not admitted. Should he have been admitted, Mr. Attorney General?
JS: You know, I don’t know about that. There are protections and privacy protections for children and families, but I’m just not aware of that.
HH: All right, there’s an organization…
JS: It would be under HHS’ control.
HH: There’s an organization called Kids in Need of Defense, www.supportKIND.org, and they are, they’re liberal activists, but they have a point that these children deserve representation, because many of them are eligible for asylum or refugee status. You’re the chief law enforcement officer. Are you guaranteeing that these 10,000 children have adequate access to legal counsel?
JS: I’m guaranteeing that they’re treated properly and lawfully. But so much of this is not valid, these claims. You just can’t decide you want to come to America regardless, and when you’re not, don’t meet the standards for asylum demand entry to the United States, demand that you appoint lawyers, and demand that you go through prolonged trials. About 20% of the unaccompanied children, come by themselves, that are stopped, are denied immediately. And 80, then the rest go through an asylum process, which is fair and just and takes time. And they get a hearing. And the judges are well aware that they’re young, and they treat them with the proper care and concern. And of the 80% who actually go through asylum processes, only 20% are successful. Most are denied, and many of them have no legitimate claim at all. They were just coming here because they’d like to make more money or for some economic reason.

HH: Now I understand there’s a spectrum on this set of children that we’re talking about, these 10,000 kids who are in custody, the 100,000 who are not in the custody of HHS, so 110,000 children. But among those, I think we’ll agree there are some who are obviously coming as just simple economic journeyers. Others are refugees and asylum. But don’t they all need counsel to be able to navigate our system? I don’t know that it’s a Constitutional right, but it seems to be a moral right.
JS: No, I don’t think it’s a moral right, Hugh. No, no. If you come to the country, you should come through, first, through the port of entry and make a claim of asylum if you think you have a legitimate asylum claim. You shouldn’t try to get across the border at some desert site, some remote site unlawfully and expect not to be promptly deported. We’ve caught, over the years, millions of people, and they’ve been promptly deported. They don’t get trial in federal court.
HH: But I am worried that a legitimate asylum seeker, refugee, would get to the country any way that they could, and that once here, language or barriers of age or maturity would prevent them from making the necessary application. And in this, I’m not, you know, I’m a conservative. I’m for the border fence. I’m for a double long sided border fence, and have been since before President Trump was for it. But I do care about these kids, and I’m worried about abuse and neglect in large-scale facilities, you know, beadle [Mr. Bumble], from Oliver Twist, if you remember the guy who ran that, and I’ve got Dickensian visions of these facilities. And no one I know has been there, including you. Aren’t you worried?
JS: Well, I believe we’ve got great people at Health and Human Services who are managing this. They stay under the Secretary of Homeland Security for only 72 hours maximum, and they’re then to be placed with Health and Human Services. And they, we have had some surges that have stressed HHS and DHS and how they handle the children, but for the most part, we’ve been able to transport them. Actually, what’s happening, when we say they’re in HHS custody, that means they’re in the custody of some, often, some family person who’s holding them as they’ve wanted to be held. They get, we take them as one witness at the committee said, to their destination city. And that may be Boston. It may be Chicago. We take them from the border to Boston at our expense so they can stay with somebody pending these claims of asylum. It’s really almost unbelievable how this works. So the wall, as you suggest, would really be a deterrent for that. We want people to file their application, not come unlawfully. And if they think their children are entitled to have, be here, then they get to come, then they should apply properly for asylum.
HH: Mr. Attorney General, are you a grandfather?
JS: Yes, I am.
HH: Can you imagine your grandchildren separated from your children for a period of 72 hours or even longer in a dormitory with up to, the deputy secretary told me, 1,000 other children and the impact on them of that?

JS: Hugh, you can’t, the United States can’t be a total guarantor that every parent who comes to the country unlawfully with a child is guaranteed that they won’t be, is guaranteed that they will be able to have their hand on that child the entire time. That’s just not the way it works.
HH: But we’re the United States of…
JS: But to be clear, in my opinion, I’ll agree with you this. I agree with you that I wish the system would allow for that. I wish we could afford to do that. And maybe we’ll head in that direction. I certainly think that would be preferable if we could do so. But the law says that parents who come unlawfully are subject to prosecution. And the law says we must carefully take care of any children that come, and they must be held not by the law enforcement branch, but held by our Health and Human Services branch to ensure they’re properly taken care of.
HH: Would you recommend to the President an executive order that says construct facilities that allow parents in detention to remain with their minor children, at least those who are under the age of 15 or 16, especially toddlers and infants, because we’re the United States of America. We can afford to build these sorts of facilities. And I, by the way, agree with zero tolerance for people who aren’t asylum seekers or refugees.
JS: Yeah.
HH: But we can afford this, and it’s so inhuman to take children away from their parents.
JS: Well, it is a tough thing when children, always tough to separate children from their parents, of course. But it happens, sadly, every day when people go to jail in America.
HH: Well, I hope you can look at that, because I think it’s a killer issue as it is, because it resonates with parents and grandparents everywhere. Let me turn to F-1 visas. This is a second part of the immigration conversation. Newsweek reported in February, Mr. Attorney General, that the FBI director said, “Chinese intelligence operatives are littered across U.S. universities possibly to obtain information in fields like technology. Schools have little understanding of this major predicament. In fact, there are 274,000 F-1 visa holders from the People’s Republic of China.” This is a counterintelligence issue. What are we doing about it?
JS: I think it’s a very serious issue. Our universities have welcomed students from around the world. They’re very proud of that. But we are seeing exactly what you just mentioned. I have serious concern about people from other countries, and notably China, where they come here to go to our best universities, work their way into the most technically advanced departments, and often transmit information, some of it improperly and illegally, back to their home countries. It is a big problem. And this country cannot afford to spend billions and billions of dollars in the private sector to develop technologies and then have it stolen from us. And I think it’s, the President and I believe the FBI and others are far more

focused on that in recent years since I’ve been here. It’s been raised up as a top priority of our national security division in the FBI.
HH: Of the 274,000 people here from the People’s Republic of China on F-1 visas, what percentage, do you think, pose counterintelligence risks?
JS: Well, I think it would be, you know, a smaller number, but even if it were 10%, you’re looking at huge numbers. I mean, this is a real problem. And I have no idea exactly what the percentage is, but I am certain that there are many people here that return back home to China and are milked for everything they learn. And many of them have obtained considerable information while they’re here.
HH: How do we keep track of them? Are we monitoring them on the campuses through undercover agents, informants? What are we doing?
JS: You can’t monitor 274,000 people. This is just a huge problem. And we’ve got to be more careful about who we admit first. Secondly, they should periodically have to report in as to what they are doing, and we could make sure then whether or not they should continue here. But what we know is people come as students, and the next thing you know, they’re working with a defense contractor or some other business in a way that provides intelligence for China or other countries. It’s a very big problem.
HH: Have you discussed…it is. Have you discussed with Secretary Pompeo or Director of National Intelligence Coats or CIA Director Haspel how we raise with the Chinese this problem, because if I were their intelligence agency, I’d be running as many of these kids as I could as agents.
JS: It’s been discussed, yes, at the highest levels of this government. I’ll just say it that way. And the FBI, which is part of the Department of Justice, the FBI is working with those agencies right now, and it’s a difficult thing. And we’ve got, we may even have to have some legislative changes. But the situation is not healthy. We need to take it seriously. We can’t stick our head in the sand. And I strongly believe there’s more that needs to be done.
HH: Let me close by talking about Masterpiece Cakeshop, if I can. How did you view that decision yesterday, Mr. Attorney General?
JS: Well, we were certainly pleased with the outcome. It was a 7-2 vote. It was more technical than we would like, but it still was a big victory. We filed a brief in support of the baker. So we were very happy, the Department of Justice was, with the result of that. We’ve got a florist case that’s coming along also, and that one will raise some similar issues. So it’s a big question, problem for people like this baker who basically can lose their whole business because they’re not able to freely exercise their religious beliefs. We believe the 1st Amendment, not believe, it’s in fact in the 1st Amendment that you have the right to exercise your religious beliefs, not just think it in a closet somewhere, and live

those beliefs where possible. And we think that the Court’s outcome was correct. We’re very pleased with that.
HH: Justice Kennedy in dicta in the majority opinion wrote, “When it comes to weddings, it can be assumed that a member of the clergy who objects to gay marriage on moral and religious grounds could not be compelled to perform the ceremony without denial of his or her right to the free exercise of religion. This refusal would be well understood in our Constitutional order as an exercise of religion, and exercise that gay persons could recognize and accept without serious diminishment to their own dignity and worth. Yet if that exception were not confined, then a long list of persons who provide goods and services for marriages and weddings might refuse to do so for gay persons, thus resulting in a community-wide stigma inconsistent with the history and dynamics of civil rights law that ensure equal access to goods, services and public accommodations.” Now that, Mr. Attorney General, is a sweeping, I think, piece of dicta that says there’s a lot of free exercise room here for not only clergy to not perform weddings with which they don’t agree, but that protects the not for profit status, for example, of Christian colleges from a Bob Jones University-like attack from that 1983 case. Do you agree with my reading of that?
JS: Well, I think as usual, your Department of Justice experience served you well. I think yes, that’s essentially true. So what you’re got is public accommodation laws under the state of Colorado, in this case, and that public accommodation says if somebody comes in your business, you have to serve them. But it does not require you, we think, and the Supreme Court has held at least in this case, that you’re not required to provide a cake at somebody’s wedding that you don’t approve of because of your religious beliefs. I think, Hugh, that we’ve got really too much litigation in this country and too much people standing on rights. I mean, like surely somebody else will provide a cake for a wedding. Shouldn’t we all be a little more respectful of each other and allow people to exercise their religion even if we would not share that same view?
HH: I agree. And it came up, the tax exemption status came up in the oral argument in Masterpiece, and most people are worried about that. As I said, this wasn’t a hard case, but it was a dangerous one. The dangerous case is threatening tax exempt status because people believe in traditional marriage and intimacy being limited to a man and a woman inside of it. And I think Justice Kennedy was saying yes because of his comments about pastors not having to marry same sex couples. And again, you can’t make the law, I can’t make the law. I can just read what the Justice said. Do you agree that’s a fair reading of the implication of his statement?
JS: Perhaps. I have not personally studied that footnote, but it is a, the tax exempt status, is always a huge matter. And it’s a great, powerful weapon that the federal government can use, and ought to be careful about using it.
HH: I’ll go back and finish with the children where we began. Would you commit to me, Mr. Attorney General, to visit one of these facilities, because I know you, and I know that your heart will go out to these kids. And I just think this is a big blind spot for the administration.

JS: Well, I appreciate, really, your concern and other people’s concerns. But we are, the Department of Homeland Security and Department of Health and Human Services works hard at that. And we do that this, Flores is this decision, a 21 year old consent decree, that says that we can only hold children with their parents for 20 days, basically. We have a 20 day rule there that really needs to be changed. And maybe Congress only can do that. And we could use Congressional action to help us keep children together better, frankly. So yes, I think that this is an important issue. We want to do it right. We want to be sure children are treated right. But I continue to urge anybody who wants to enter this country, and want to claim asylum or break into the country illegally, do it, don’t come unlawfully. Come through the ports of entry and make your claim. That’s the proper way to do it.
HH: But if I could press you, will you go and visit one of these facilities?
JS: Well, we’ll look forward to that opportunity, but we are trying to get this law enforcement matter settled, and we’re trying to end the lawlessness at the border. The President promised the American people want it.
HH: I agree.
JS: And we have to prosecute people who enter unlawfully, and that’s taking a great deal of my time, you can be sure. And I will look into it. I’ll tell you that. I don’t know when I’ll be able to visit, but I will look into it based on this phone call. I sure will.
HH: And last question, will you go with Jeff Merkley or make it possible for Senator Merkley to get in?
JS: Well, Senator Merkley and I get along well…
HH: Yeah.
JS: And I’ll be glad to talk to him about it.
HH: Terrific.
JS: I’m not sure we can do my schedule in this fashion.
HH: Terrific. Attorney General Sessions, thanks for all the time this morning. You’ve been very generous.
JS: All right. Thank you.

Sessions appeals to 'church friends' while defending immigration policy
Jun.14.201801:57
 "If you cross the Southwest border unlawfully, then the Department of Homeland Security will arrest you and the Department of Justice will prosecute you. That is what the law calls for — and that is what we are going to do," Sessions said. "Having children does not give you immunity from arrest and prosecution." "However, we are not sending children to jail with their parents,” he said, adding that the policy "can result in short-term separation." Recommended

Sessions cites Bible in defense of breaking up families, blames migrant parents
Who’s to blame for families being separated at the border?

"Noncitizens who cross our borders unlawfully, between our ports of entry, with children are not an exception," the attorney general said. "They are the ones who broke the law•, tShheayreartehitshe—ones who endangered their own children on their trek. The United States, on the other hand, goes to extraordinary lengths to protect them while the parents go •through a short detention period."
• Cu•rre nt law does not prohibit separating children from their parents.
• Crossing the border illegally is a misdemeanor for the first offense, and when parents are charged they end up in federal and separated from their children— an increasingly dire situation that has drawn criticism from lawmakers in both major parties, as well as Christian groups, including the Rev. Franklin Graham, a supporter of President Donald Trump. Graham said this week that the administration's efforts that led to families being "ripped apart" were “disgraceful.”
In addition, several evangelical groups sent a letter to the White House this month, asking Trump to protect families at the border that were fleeing violence.


 Sen. James Lankford, R-Okla., a evangelical pastor and Christian camp director, tweeted Thursday morning that he was personally asking the White House "to keep families together as much as we can." In his remarks, Sessions hit back at the "concerns raised by our church friends about separating families," calling the criticism "not fair or logical" and quoting Scripture in his defense of the administration's tough policies. "Persons who violate the law of our nation are subject to prosecution ... I would cite you to the Apostle Paul and his clear and wise command in Romans 13 to obey the laws of the government because God has ordained the government for his purposes," Sessions said. "Orderly and lawful processes are good in themselves ... and protect the weak and it protects the lawful." He called on religious leaders to "speak up strongly to urge anyone who would come here to apply lawfully, to wait their turn and not violate the law." Later Thursday, White House Press Secretary Sarah Sanders doubled down on Sessions' comments, saying it is "very biblical to enforce the law." "That is actually repeated a number of times throughout the Bible," she said, responding to a question about Sessions' comments about Scripture's supporting the administration's policies.

Immigrant families separated: Ryan calls for law change, Pelosi labels policy 'barbaric'
Jun.14.201801:09

 Many of the children separated from their parents have ended up in enormous facilities that more closely resemble prisons, where they spend 22 hours per day during the week locked inside overcrowded buildings.
Sessions, however, said the U.S. government facilities, which are run by the Department of Health and Human Services, "care for the children in a good and decent and proper way" and blamed the parents of the children for subjecting them to "such a treacherous journey."
"It's not as if we just want to see if we can be mean to children," Sessions added.
The attorney general also defended his ruling this week that fear of domestic abuse or gang violence is not an acceptable basis for granting asylum.
He claimed that he had not made new law and that he had "simply restated and implemented what Congress has passed: Asylum is generally not for those who have suffered a private act of violence."
"I am not going to apologize for carrying out our laws," he added.

Case 2:18-cv-00939-MJP Document 1-2 Filed 06/26/18 Page 93 of 380
Chairman Portman, Ranking Member Carper, and members of the Subcommittee, it is my honor to appear on behalf of the Department of Health and Human Services (HHS). I am Steven Wagner, the Acting Assistant Secretary for Children and Families (ACF). In this capacity, I oversee the work of the Office of Refugee Resettlement (ORR), which is responsible for the care and placement of unaccompanied alien children (UAC). In my testimony today, I will describe the current state of the UAC program, and then discuss a number of developments in the
policies and administration since February 2016.
Current State of the Program In fiscal year (FY) 2017, 40,810 children were referred to ORR from the Department of Homeland Security (DHS). In FY 2018 (through March), we have had 21,574 referrals. Although March and April of FY 2017 had the lowest referrals since FY 2012, referrals started to slowly increase in May of 2017, and today are significantly higher than just a couple of months ago. To illustrate, in March 2017, ORR had 755 referrals; while in March 2018, ORR had 4,204 referrals. At this time, we have no temporary facilities open at Department of Defense locations. The last one closed in February 2017. As of March 2018, we are operating one temporary influx facility at a Department of Labor site. ORR now has its largest permanent shelter capacity at over 9,800 beds, and we continue to maintain the majority of our shelter capacity along the southern border.

In FY 2017, 94 Salvador. So far in FY 2018, the number of children referred from those countries is 93 percent. Teenagers made up 83 percent of referrals in FY 2017 and 87 percent in FY 2018. Children from Guatemala, El Salvador, Honduras, and Mexico who migrate to the U.S. are particularly vulnerable to being exploited by human traffickers en route and at their destination. In FY 2017, children typically stayed in ORR custody for 51 days and so far in FY 2018 (through March) average length of stay has been 56 days. ORR releases the majority of UAC to sponsors. In FY 2017, ORR released 93 percent of children to a sponsor. Of those, ORR released 49 percent to parents, 41 percent to close relatives, and 10 percent to other-than-close relatives or non-relatives. In FY 2018, we have released 90 percent of children to individual sponsors and of those sponsors, 41 percent were parents, 47 percent were close relatives, and 11 percent were other-than-close relatives or non-relatives. In FY 2017, ORR performed 3,173 home studies and provided post-release services to 13,381 children, increasing the latter by 27 percent from the previous year.
Program Enhancements Since February 2016 Since February 2016, ORR has made a number of policy enhancements in the areas of sponsor assessments and home studies. Sponsor assessment is the ORR process for evaluating potential
-being. As part of the determination of whether an individual is a suitable sponsor, ORR requires its case managers to
interview prospective sponsors;

ion for Release conduct background checks on all prospective sponsors; coordinate fingerprint checks of the Federal Bureau of Investigation (FBI) database for non-parental sponsors, or for parental sponsors where there is a documented risk to the safety of the child, the child is especially vulnerable, or the case is being referred for a mandatory home study; coordinate a check of the immigration Central Index System in some cases. require sponsors to sign a Sponsor Care Agreement.

In the area of sponsor assessments, ORR has decreased the ability of potential sponsors to use

fraudulent documents during the sponsor assessment process. ORR added guidance in January

2016, and further refined it in October and November 2016, on the types of documents ORR

accepts as evidence of identity for the potential sponsor, the household members, and any adults listed in a sponsor care plan.1 The guidance also clarified what constitutes acceptable documents

to prove the prospective

-child

relationship.2 ORR also added an alternative method to verify a potential

3

These changes help to protect children from traffickers, smugglers, and others who may wish to

do them harm. If ORR discovers that a sponsor is using fraudulent documents, ORR denies release.4 ORR reports the cases to the HHS/Office of the Inspector General and to U.S.

The background check part of the sponsorship assessment varies depending in part on the relationship between the child and the potential sponsor. ORR conducts criminal public records checks and Sex Offender Registry Checks on all potential sponsors. ORR conducts National (FBI) Criminal History Checks, based on digital fingerprints or digitized paper prints, for all potential sponsors, except parents. ORR conducts these checks on parents where there is a documented risk to the safety of the UAC, the child is especially vulnerable, and/or the case is being referred for a home study. In the case of parental sponsors, a documented risk to the safety of the child may be, for example, a drug or alcohol addiction. In those cases, ORR runs an FBI criminal background check and an immigration check. ORR would want to determine if the drug or alcohol addiction led to criminal acts, and obtain a comprehensive assessment of any potential risks to the child. ORR would then assess those results under its policies to determine if release to the particular sponsor is barred. ORR would also assess the severity of the initial, identified safety risk, the length of time that has passed since any events related to the risk, any evidence of rehabilitation, and the parent/child relationship. Each case is unique, and ORR addresses the facts accordingly. ORR also conducts Immigration Status Checks through the Central Index System on all potential sponsors, except parents. Again, ORR conducts these checks on parents where there is a documented risk to the safety of the UAC, the child is especially vulnerable, and/or the case is being referred for a home study. In addition, ORR conducts Child Abuse and Neglect Checks on all unrelated sponsors. ORR conducts these checks on parents or other relatives if the case requires a home study or a special concern has been identified.

for their child's appearance at all immigration proceedings. To emphasize the importance of a

at immigration proceedings, in December 2017, ORR made attendance at the LOPC a criteria in the sponsor assessment process.7

In the area of home studies, ORR made two significant policy changes in March 2016. A home
study is an in-
and well-being. The process includes background checks of the sponsor and adult household
members, home visits, in-person interviews of the proposed sponsor and possibly interviews with
other household members, and post-release services. The William Wilberforce Trafficking
Victims Protection Reauthorization Act of 2008 (TVPRA of 2008) mandates home studies in

certain situations, but the March 2016 policy changes led to an increase in discretionary home studies, which are home studies that are not required by law.8 One of these policy changes focused on tender age UAC. ORR began requiring home studies for all UAC 12 years of age and younger being released to non-relative sponsors.9 The other change underscored the need for case managers and case coordinators, who have direct contact with UAC, to recommend home studies, even if not required by the TVPRA of 2008, if they think a home study would provide additional information required to determine that the sponsor is able to care for the health, safety, and well-being of the child.10

Post-release Another step in improving the safety of releases is to contact the child and the sponsor shortly after release, which is a critical adjustment period. To accomplish this, ORR initiated safety and well-being calls.11 A case manager contacts the child and the sponsor 30 days after release. The case manager confirms that the child is still residing with the sponsor, is enrolled in school, is aware of upcoming court dates, and, most importantly, is safe. If the case manager, or any other

safety or well-being, they are required to

post-release reporting

system for notifications of concern. 12 Under the system, they must report all concerns to

appropriate investigative agencies,

well-being.13 To remove children from unsafe situations, ORR reports notifications of concern to local law enforcement.
In addition, ORR has expanded the services of its National Call Center, which was stood up in September 2014. The National Call Center is a resource for all children and sponsors postrelease.14 It is available 24 hours a day, seven days a week,15 and provides referrals to community assistance and other guidance to sponsors and children seeking help, including those with safety concerns.16
From October to December 2017, ORR attempted to reach 7,635 UAC and their sponsors. Of this number, ORR reached and received agreement to participate in the safety and well-being call from approximately 86 percent of sponsors. From these calls, ORR learned that 6,075 UAC remained with their sponsors. Twenty-eight UAC had run away, five had been removed from the United States, and 52 had relocated to live with a non-sponsor. ORR was unable to determine with certainty the whereabouts of 1,475 UAC. Based on the calls, ORR referred 792 cases, which were in need of further assistance, to the National Call Center for additional information and services.

importance of the post-release period, we are taking a fresh look at that question as a matter of both legal interpretation and appropriate policy. Specifically, we are exploring the question of

on what we have learned so far, if ORR were to remain legally obligated for the welfare of UAC after their release to a sponsor, or took on additional protective measures even if not legally obligated, those procedures would require a significant expansion of the current program structure and an increase in resources, and possibly additional legal authorities to further clarify
le.
Interagency Communication ORR continues to develop its interagency communication efforts. In particular, I note that ORR shares information with its Federal partners as an additional means of reinforcing the safety of UAC as well as their participation in immigration proceedings. For example, ORR provides EOIR with monthly UAC data, which EOIR uses through its Legal Orientation Program for Custodians of UAC.
Second, ORR is working to enhance its day-to-day consultations with DHS. Under the current process, 24 hours before ORR releases a UAC from custody, it notifies identity, location, and relationship to the UAC, and ORR asks for DHS input regarding the safety of the release for the UAC and for the community. ORR notifies DHS again 24 hours after the

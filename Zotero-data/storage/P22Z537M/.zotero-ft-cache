WASHINGTON — Senior White House adviser Kellyanne Conway said Sunday that "nobody likes" the separation of migrant children from their parents at the nation's southern border but took issue with the idea that the Trump administration is using the children to force Democrats to the table on border security.

"As a mother, as a Catholic, as somebody who has a conscience ... I will tell you that nobody likes this policy," Conway said on NBC's "Meet the Press" Sunday. But Conway also repeated President Donald Trump's assertion that the burden is on Democrats to end the separations — while also rejecting the idea that the White House is using the public outcry over the separations as a way to exert leverage over Democrats resistant to Trump's most stringent proposed overhauls to the immigration system. "I certainly don't want anybody to use these kids as leverage," she said, adding that she objects "very forcefully" to that implication.

Truth and Consequences at the White House
Conway suggested that that unnamed official should come forward.
"I want that person to say it to my face, I really do," she said. "I'll meet them at the White House today because I think that is a disgrace."
Still, Conway — as the president has — put the burden squarely on congressional Democrats to address broad immigration reforms in order to solve the larger crisis at the border.

Despite claims, GOP immigration bill would not end family separation, experts say
"If the Democrats are serious, and if a lot of Republicans are serious, they'll come together. They won't just talk about just this week, just the Dreamers, or just the wall, or just catch and release. It's all of the above," Conway said.
Separating migrant families is a policy announced by the Trump administration this spring, and the White House has not identified any law that specifically requires it. "If you are smuggling a child then we will prosecute you, and that child will be separated from you as required by law," Attorney General Jeff Sessions said in May. "If you don't like that, then don't smuggle children over our border."
Conway indicated some agreement with the idea that many migrants are using their children as bargaining chips in their efforts to enter the U.S. illegally.
"Nobody likes seeing babies ripped from their mothers' arms, from their mothers' wombs, frankly, but we have to make sure that DHS' laws are understood through the soundbite culture that we live in," Conway said, adding that "some adults are using children to gain access to the border."
Democratic Rep. Adam Schiff, who also joined "Meet the Press" Sunday, called the separation policy flatly "immoral."
"What the administration is doing is they're using the grief, the tears, the pain of these kids as mortar to build their wall," he said. "And it's an effort to extort a bill to their liking in the Congress. It's, I think, deeply unethical."

DHS considering proposal to separate children from adults at border
By Mary Kay Mallonee Updated 3:31 AM ET, Sat March 4, 2017

STORY HIGHLIGHTS
The proposal is meant to deter the exploitation of children, a DHS official said

(CNN) — The Department of Homeland Security is considering a proposal to separate children from adults when they are trying to enter the country illegally at the southern border, a senior DHS official confirmed to CNN on Friday.

The adults could be kept in detention, and the children could be moved elsewhere under protected status
here and stay."

The official said the proposal is meant to deter the exploitation of children.
"We are trying to find ways to deter the use of children in illegal immigration," he said. "We are seeing kids essentially kidnapped and used to get

Currently, when adults enter the country accompanied by children, they are generally released into the US and able to stay in the country, pending disposition of their cases, the official said.

The proposal would allow US immigration officials to separate children from the adults they came here with. The adults could be kept in detention, and the children could be moved elsewhere under protected status, possibly with family members already in the country or to state protective custody, such as child protective services.

The official said children were being exploited in multiple ways, citing parents taking them on dangerous journeys and smugglers and non-parents claiming the children as their own in order to enter and stay in the United States. The official was unable to say how agents at the border determine family relationships.

"People are taking advantage of the system," the official said, acknowledging there may be perception issues with the proposal.

In a statement to CNN, DHS spokesman David Lapan said the agency "continually explores options that may discourage those from even beginning the journey."

"The journey north is a dangerous one, with too many situations where children -- brought by parents, relatives or smugglers -- are often exploited, abused or may even lose their lives," Lapan said.

No final decision has been made on the proposal, which is still being worked on by staff, the official said.

Reuters first reported the proposal.

If enacted, the policy would be at odds with a pledge Trump made on the campaign trail in an August, 2015, interview with NBC.
At the time, he said, "We're going to keep the families together. We have to keep the families together. ... But they have to go."
Leon Fresco, a former DOJ official in the Obama administration, said the last administration considered, but ultimately rejected, the move.
"It was never implemented because the idea was that it was too detrimental to the safety of the children to separate them from their parents, and the thinking was it was always preferable to detain the family as a unit or release the family as the unit," Fresco said.
He said he knew of career holdovers at the department who had been in favor of the move and said the change was more likely to occur because those people were now in a position to make it happen.
Fresco also said the impetus for the change is the Flores v. Lynch court case, which held that the government is required to release minors from detention expeditiously even if they are accompanied by their parents, not just if they're unaccompanied. The ruling created problems for the government in detaining undocumented families who were seeking entrance to the US, he said.

as too extreme and too complicated. After coming under intense criticism from the press, human-rights advocates, and members of Congress, Kelly backed off from it. But the idea persisted. A few months later, in August, 2017, a group of officials at the Department of Homeland Security gathered to brainstorm new ways to toughen immigration enforcement. Among those leading the discussion was an official named Gene Hamilton, a former aide to Jeff Sessions, the Attorney General, and a close ally of Stephen Miller, the President's chief immigration adviser. "Hamilton told us that over the next few days we'd need to generate paperwork laying out everything we could do to deter immigrants from coming to the U.S. illegally," a person who attended the meeting told me. Memos were drafted outlining a range of possible policies; one of them was separating parents from their kids at the border. "All the memos sucked," the person said. "The outcome was predetermined. We didn't have time to work out any of the policy differences. Some of the ideas didn't make sense. Some were illegal, and some, like separating kids, were just immoral." Many of the proposals, including the one involving family separation, "got bogged down in the clearance process, because of how difficult and controversial it was," the person said. And yet every few months the idea would resurface in discussions. "It would rear its head again."
Last summer, public defenders and immigration judges along the border began noticing an alarming pattern. Parents who had crossed into the U.S. with their children were arriving to detention facilities without them. The reason had to do with the Department ofJustice, which was pushing U.S. Attorneys across the country to prosecute more border crossers for entering the U.S. illegally. In the past, many of these people, especially those with children, had been released pending the outcome of their civil immigration cases; now they were being arrested and held for extended periods by the D.H.S. The government was treating their children as though they'd come to the U.S. alone, as unaccompanied minors, and turning them over to the Office of Refugee Resettlement, a branch of the Department of Health and Human Services. There appeared to be no coordination between the different

government agencies involved, so parents were losing contact with their own children. "They have no idea where their child is," one assistant public defender, in Arizona, told the Houston Chronicle last fall. In one judicial order, a federal magistrate judge, in El Paso, Texas, asked the government, ''What are the arresting agency's procedures for providing information (e.g. location and well-being) regarding the unaccompanied minor children of undocumented alien defendants charged with a petty misdemeanor such as illegal entry ... ?" Government lawyers didn't seem to have an answer.
At first, the Trump Administration denied there was a formal familyseparation policy in place. Then, as the evidence mounted, it claimed that it was only trying to protect immigrant kids from smugglers and imposters posing as their guardians. In February, the A.C.L.U. sued the government for separating a Congolese mother from her seven-year-old daughter, for more than three months, after they had arrived in San Diego seeking asylum. The mother was held in California, while her daughter was sent to Chicago. The D.H.S. claimed that it had doubts about whether the woman was truly the child's mother, yet it waited four months to administer a DNA test. In April, the Times reported that more than seven hundred families had been separated since October, including more than a hundred children under the age of four. A government spokesperson responded, "D.H.S. must protect the best interests of minor children crossing our borders, and occasionally this results in separating children from an adult they are traveling with."
Last month, the pretense fell away completely. On April 6th, Jeff Sessions and Kirstjen Nielsen, the head of Homeland Security, announced a zero-tolerance policy for immigrants at the border. Anyone who didn't cross the U.S. border at an official port of entry would be criminally prosecuted, even if they were seeking asylum, and those travelling with their children would be separated from them. The policy was now official, and the Administration acknowledged its rationale: it was separating families to discourage others from travelling to the United States illegally. (A recent analysis, by Dara Lind at Vox, shows how the D.H.S.'s own data undermines the argument that this

policy will act as a deterrent.) According to the D.H.S., six hundred and fiftyeight children were separated from their parents between May 6th and May 19th. Reports have surfaced of children, some as young as toddlers, being wrested from family members, and of parents being deported before they could locate their children, who remain stranded in the U.S. "Little kids are begging and screaming not to be taken from parents, and they're being hauled off," Lee Gelernt, a veteran attorney for the A.C.L.U., told the Washington Post. "It's as bad as anything I've seen in twenty-five-plus years of doing this work." Research has shown that removing a young child from her primary caregivers for even a short period can cause long-term psychological harm.
As my colleague Amy Davidson Sorkin has written, the message from senior Administration officials has been unapologetic. Sessions likened immigrants crossing the border with their own children to smugglers, warning them, "If you are smuggling a child, then we will prosecute you, and that child will be separated from you as required by law." Nielsen, for her part, simply waved away questions about the policy's impact on children. 'What we'll be doing is prosecuting parents who have broken the law, just as we do every day in the United States ofAmerica," she said during a recent Senate hearing. "The child, under law, goes to H.H.S."-the Department of Health and Human Services-"for care and custody."
Yet the network of child shelters overseen by H.H.S. is already operating at more than ninety-per-cent capacity. There's been talk of sending children to military bases, where there's more space. "In the immigration context, the government has never taken a stand against the protection of kids in this country," Muzaffar Chishti, an immigration expert at the Migration Policy Institute, told me. "For the first time, it is now formally taking a position that explicitly goes against the best interests of kids."
I asked the person who had attended the D.H.S. meeting with Gene Hamilton what had changed since last year, when the Administration was reluctant to publicly embrace the family-separation policy. The person pointed

to the President. In the early days ofTrump's Presidency, migrants were anxious about how harsh his policies might prove to be. For a few months, illegal border crossings declined-a fact that Trump bragged about and took personal pride in. But by the end ofthe year the numbers had returned to levels roughly consistent with where they'd been just before he took office. Trump has complained that U.S. immigration laws are "pathetic" and riddled with "loopholes," including, among other things, the "catch and release" of
asylum seekers. He's also held Nielsen personally responsible for the rise in
migration from Central America. "What you're seeing now is the President's frustration with the fact that the numbers are back up," the person told me. "The only tools the Administration has now, in the absence oflegislation, is to
make life miserable for people."

FOR IMMEDIATE RELEASE

Department of Justice Office of Public Affairs

Attorney General Announces Zero-Tolerance Policy for Criminal Illegal Entry
Attorney General Jeff Sessions today notified all U.S. Attorney’s Offices along the Southwest Border of a new “zero-tolerance policy” for offenses under 8 U.S.C. § 1325(a), which prohibits both attempted illegal entry and illegal entry into the United States by an alien. The implementation of the Attorney General’s zero-tolerance policy comes as the Department of Homeland Security reported a 203 percent increase in illegal border crossings from March 2017 to March 2018, and a 37 percent increase from February 2018 to March 2018—the largest month-to-month increase since 2011.

“The situation at our Southwest Border is unacceptable. Congress has failed to pass effective legislation that serves the national interest—that closes dangerous loopholes and fully funds a wall along our southern border. As a result, a crisis has erupted at our Southwest Border that necessitates an escalated effort to prosecute those who choose to illegally cross our border,” said Attorney General Jeff Sessions. “To those who wish to challenge the Trump Administration’s commitment to public safety, national security, and the rule of law, I warn you: illegally entering this country will not be rewarded, but will instead be met with the full prosecutorial powers of the Department of Justice. To the Department’s prosecutors, I urge you: promoting and enforcing the rule of law is vital to protecting a nation, its borders, and its citizens. You play a critical part in fulfilling these goals, and I thank you for your continued efforts in seeing to it that our laws—and as a result, our nation—are respected.”

On April 11, 2017, Attorney General Jeff Sessions announced a renewed commitment to criminal immigration enforcement. As part of that announcement, the Attorney General issued a memorandum to all federal prosecutors and directed them to prioritize the prosecution of certain criminal immigration offenses.

Today’s zero-tolerance policy further directs each U.S. Attorney’s Office along the Southwest Border (i.e., Southern District of California, District of Arizona, District of New Mexico, Western District of Texas, and the Southern District of Texas) to adopt a policy to prosecute all Department of Homeland Security referrals of section 1325(a) violations, to the extent practicable.

Attorney General Sessions Delivers Remarks Discussing the Immigration Enforcement Actions of the Trump Administration
San Diego, CA ~ Monday, May 7, 2018
Thank you all for being here. Thank you to Tom Homan. Tom, you have done outstanding work leading ICE. Thank you for your more than 30 years of service in law enforcement. We are going to miss you. Today we are here to send a message to the world: we are not going to let this country be overwhelmed. People are not going to caravan or otherwise stampede our border. We need legality and integrity in the system. That’s why the Department of Homeland Security is now referring 100 percent of illegal Southwest Border crossings to the Department of Justice for prosecution. And the Department of Justice will take up those cases. I have put in place a “zero tolerance” policy for illegal entry on our Southwest border. If you cross this border unlawfully, then we will prosecute you. It’s that simple. If you smuggle illegal aliens across our border, then we will prosecute you. If you are smuggling a child, then we will prosecute you and that child will be separated from you as required by law. If you make false statements to an immigration officer or file a fraudulent asylum claim, that’s a felony. If you help others to do so, that’s a felony, too. You’re going to jail. So if you’re going to come to this country, come here legally. Don’t come here illegally. In order to carry out these important new enforcement policies, I have sent 35 prosecutors to the Southwest and moved 18 immigration judges to the border. These are supervisory judges that don’t have existing caseloads and will be able to function full time on moving these cases. That will be about a 50 percent increase in the number of immigration judges who will be handling the asylum claims. These actions are necessary. And they are made even more necessary by the massive increases in illegal crossings in recent months. This February saw 55 percent more border apprehensions than last February. This March saw triple the number from last March. April saw triple the number last April. The trends are clear: this must end.

Eleven million people are already here illegally. That’s more than the population of Portugal or the state of Georgia.
The Congressional Budget Office estimates that those 11 million have 4.5 million children who are American citizens. Combined, that group would be our fifth-most populous state.
This situation has been many years in the making.
For decades, the American people have been pleading with our elected representatives for a lawful system of immigration that serves the national interest—a system we can be proud of.
That is not too much to ask. The American people are right and just and decent to ask for this. They are right to want a safe, secure border and a government that knows who is here and who isn’t.
Donald Trump ran for office on that idea. I believe that is a big reason why he won. He is on fire about this. This entire government knows it.
The American people have a right to expect that the laws that their representatives voted for are going to be carried out. Failure to enforce our duly-enacted laws would be an affront to the American people and a threat to our very system of self-government.
And these laws are the most generous immigration laws in the world. We accept 1.1 million lawful permanent residents every year—that’s more than the population of Montana, every single year. These are the highest numbers in the world.
I have no doubt that many of those crossing our border illegally are leaving difficult situations. But we cannot take everyone on Earth who is in a difficult situation.
According to a Gallup poll from a few years ago, 150 million people around the world want to immigrate to the United States. Gallup says that 37 percent of Liberians want to immigrate to the United States. One fifth of Cambodians want to move here. One-in-six Salvadorans are already in the United States—and another 19 percent tell Gallup they want to come here.
It’s obvious that we cannot take everyone who wants to come here without also hurting the interests of the citizens we are sworn to serve and protect.
We have to have limits. And Congress has already set them.
And if you want to change our laws, then pass a bill in Congress. Persuade your fellow citizens to your point of view.
Immigrants should ask to apply lawfully before they enter our country. Citizens of other countries don’t get to violate our laws or rewrite them for us. People around the world have no right to demand entry in violation of our sovereignty.
This is a great nation—the greatest in the history of the world. It is no surprise that people want to come here. But they must do so properly. They must follow our laws—or not come here at all. Make no mistake, the objections, the lawsuits, the sanctuary jurisdictions are often the product of a radical open border philosophy. They oppose all enforcement.
And so this Department, under President Trump’s leadership, is enforcing the law without exception. We will finally secure this border so that we can give the American people safety and peace of mind. That’s what the people deserve.

MEMORANDUM FOR FEDERAL PROSECUTORS ALONG THE SOUTHWEST BORDER

FROM: SUBJECT:

THE ATTORNEY GENERA(W -----:, ,
~#118"
Zero-Tolerance for Offenses Under 8 U.S .C. § 1325(a)

On April 11, 2017, I issued a memorandum to all federal prosecutors entitled "Renewed Commitment to Criminal Immigration Enforcement," in which I directed the prioritization of the prosecution of certain criminal immigration offenses. I further directed each United States Attorney's Office along the Southwest Border to work with the Department of Homeland Security to develop guidelines for prosecuting offenses under 8 U.S.C. § 1325(a).

Those seeking to further an illegal goal constantly alter their tactics to take advantage of weak points. That means we must effectively respond with smart changes also. The recent increase in aliens illegally crossing our Southwest Border requires an updated approach. Past prosecution initiatives in certain districts-such as Operation Streamline-led to a decrease in illegal activities in those districts. We must continue to execute effective policies to meet new challenges.

Accordingly, I direct each United States Attorney's Office along the Southwest Border­

to the extent practicable, and in consultation with DHS- to adopt immediately a zero-tolerance policy for all offenses referred for prosecution under section 1325(a). This zero-tolerance policy

"

shall supersede any existing policies. If adopting such a policy requires additional resources, each

office shall identify and request such additional resources.

You are on the front lines of this battle. I respect you and your team. Your dedication and insight into border reality is invaluable. Keep us informed, and don't hesitate to give us suggestions for improvement. Remember, our goal is not simply more cases. It is to end the illegality in our immigration system.

This guidance is not intended to, does not, and may not be relied upon to create, any right or benefit, substantive or procedural, enforceable at law or in equity by any party against the United States, its departments, agencies, or entities, its officers, employees, or agents, or any other person.

Asylum seekers reportedly denied entry at border as Trump tightens 'zero tolerance' immigration policies

EL PASO -- Immigration advocates are accusing U.S. border guards of refusing asylum-seekers entry to the U.S. at a bustling pedestrian bridge into the downtown of this city next to the Rio Grande.

It isn’t the first time, nor the only port of entry. But the accusation that people are again being illegally refused the opportunity to apply for asylum comes as tensions flare over “zero tolerance” measures escalating the crackdown on legal and illegal immigration by the Trump administration.

U.S. Customs and Border Protection officials say they are doing the best job they can with limited space for immigrants and limited resources. Immigration advocates say the extreme immigration enforcement is inhumane, and is taking a toll on El Paso and other cities along the border.

In recent months, migrant children have been separated from parents, immigration judges have been ordered to speed up cases and federal prosecutors have been instructed to seek criminal charges against anyone who crosses the border unlawfully. And a parade of federal officials including U.S. Vice President Mike Pence, Attorney General Jeff Sessions, and Homeland Security Secretary Kirstjen Nielsen have all made recent visits to the border to trumpet the new policies.

"Federal authorities are essentially disrupting our border existence, our way of life of people going back and forth to work, shop, visit relatives," says El Paso attorney Carlos Spector. "They're trying to deter asylum seekers, and at the same time threaten everyone else... the common denominator with this and everything we've been living is punishment, criminalization and now family separation as a deterrence." Two weeks ago, a reporter for The Dallas Morning News walking from Juarez into El Paso on the pedestrian bridge saw two CPB agents standing by the middle of the bridge, under a shaded canopy along the pedestrian walkway. The sight of agents was unusual. They were standing at the line where the U.S. boundary begins, selectively checking crossers, adding another layer of security before pedestrians can reach the official checkpoint where visitors are asked to declare their citizenship. Those seeking refuge must also get to the official checkpoint to officially request asylum. Complaints about asylum-seekers not being allowed to ask for refuge are received “multiple times and on a daily basis,” along the Texas border, said Houston-based attorney Edgar Saldivar of the ACLU of Texas.

One recent case of Central American asylum seekers being turned back after they entered U.S. territory, but before they had the opportunity to apply for asylum at the border checkpoint, was first reported by Texas Monthly. In that case, Ruben Garcia, founder of Annunciation House, a nonprofit that helps immigrants and refugees in El Paso, said CBP agents simply told certain border-crossers they couldn’t receive them. That didn’t allow the immigrants to get on U.S. soil and tell them of their fears and need for asylum, he said. “If you look indigenous and you look Central American, they will stop you,” Garcia told The Dallas Morning News. “They never ask why they are coming. They just say we can’t receive you.”

A group of a dozen people last Saturday was followed by Annunciation House staff and volunteers. Three got past the border and CFB officers and walked to the border checkpoint to make their asylum plea, but another nine Central Americans didn’t get past CFB officers who were on the bridge ahead of the border checkpoint, Garcia said.

Garcia said one sunburned Guatemalan woman holding her 10-month-old son in her arms who was identified only as Juana did manage to get across the international boundary line. “The supervisor says, ‘Take her in. She is already in,’“ Garcia recalled. Then, Juana told them, “I fear for my life,” Garcia said. U.S. Customs and Border Protection officials said, in written statements, that they are trying to manage the flow of immigrants with what they portray as finite resources, involving translators to detention space. Case complexity plays a role, too, they said in statements.
In general, the spokesman did say, “Individuals who are found to have a credible fear are referred to immigration court, where they may apply for relief from removal, including asylum..." But when asked more directly if CBP refuses to allow immigrants onto U.S. soil to ask for asylum at the El Paso bridge checkpoint, the officer in an email, “The statement is all we have at this time.”

Complaints about asylum-seekers not being allowed to ask for refuge date back to at least 2016, immigration lawyers say. That’s when there was a renewed border surge of immigrant families and immigrant minors travelling alone from El Salvador, Honduras and Guatemala.
“We really saw an uptick of this practice in late October, November, leading into the year of 2018,” said Karolina Walters, a lawyer with the American Immigration Council. “It is not just in Tijuana and El Paso.”
Months before, the American Immigration Council filed a federal suit in California challenging the alleged practice of turning away asylum seekers at land ports along the entire length of the 2,000-mile border. The case is still pending and the U.S. government seeks its dismissal.
One Honduran man, identified in the lawsuit as Jose Doe, said he tried to ask for asylum in Laredo, but U.S. border officials “misinformed” him about his rights and denied him entry, according to the suit. The suit alleges the Honduran and his family were threatened by gangs in Honduras and, then again, by gangs in Nuevo Laredo.

Saldivar of the ACLU said asylum-seekers, by law, should present themselves at ports of entry. Immigration law, the U.S. Constitution and international law guarantee their right, once they are on U.S. soil, to due process. The 1951 Refugee Convention says a refugee should not be returned to a country where they face serious threats to their life or freedom. The Refugee Convention also says that those seeking asylum shouldn’t be punished for illegal entry if they present themselves without delay.
But that doesn’t mean a Central American who makes the 2,000-mile trek to the U.S., fleeing violence or danger in their homeland, necessarily understands those rights. Federal agents can walk forward on the bridge, remaining on U.S. soil but intimidating potential refugees by asking for IDs and saying centers are full, advocates say.
Saldivar said claims that the CBP is doing the best it can with stretched resources isn’t a legitimate reason for turning people away. “That is one of their common excuses,” he said, “But, again, it is unclear what steps they are taking to ensure that people have access to asylum by the law.”
Demands of the crackdown
There’s no question that resources are stretched thin at the border. But there is a question about which resources are being stretched thin.

In April and May, Attorney General Jeff Sessions went to the border in California to announce that the Departments of Justice and Homeland Security would unreel even tougher “zero tolerance” policies against what was called unlawful immigration.
“If you cross this border unlawfully, then we will prosecute you,” Sessions said. “It’s that simple. If you smuggle illegal aliens across our border, then we will prosecute you. If you are smuggling a child, then we will prosecute you and the child will be separated from you as required by law.”
Among the most controversial of the new measures is the systematic separation of migrant children from their parents when families cross the border seeking asylum. NBC reported that the federal government oversees shelters that care for more than 11,000 unaccompanied children.
About 100 shelters used for unaccompanied immigrant children are now so full the federal government may send some children to military bases, including Fort Bliss in El Paso, according to The Hill.
It’s far more common for immigrants who cross the border unlawfully to be processed administratively though the immigration courts. Those courts were already struggling with a huge backlog when Trump took office in 2017. It has now soared by more than 100,000 cases to about 700,000 cases.
Criminal charges for crossing the border were used in some cases in the administrations of presidents George W. Bush and Barack Obama, but recent policy changes through the Justice Department call for “100 percent of illegal Southwest Border crossings” to be prosecuted by the federal criminal courts for a nonviolent offense known as improper entry, a misdemeanor. A border reentry can be prosecuted as a felony.
The heavier caseload is already showing in the federal criminal courts: Federal criminal prosecutions of those apprehended by CBP at the Mexican border jumped about 30 percent in April over March, according to the Transactional Records Access Clearinghouse.
It’s clear that Garcia in El Paso feels overwhelmed by all the policy changes. His next move will to organize more witnesses of bridge crossings--and not just in El Paso. But, he adds, “Our resources are very limited.”

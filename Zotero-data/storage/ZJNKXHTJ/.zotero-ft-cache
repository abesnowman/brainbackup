Selected Financial Data Maryland Public Schools
2016-2017 Part 3 - Analysis of Costs

INTRODUCTION

Selected Financial Data is published annually in four parts by the Maryland State Department of Education. Part 1 provides information about resources, Part 2 provides expenditure information, Part 3 describes the expenditures in terms of an average cost per pupil, and Part 4 is a time series of selected facts from Parts 1-3. Information for these reports is derived from the Annual Financial Reports submitted by the 24 local education agencies (LEAs).

membership (ADM), also called the average number belonging (ANB). This figure represents the average number of students enrolled in the district over the school year. This report also includes a table showing the per pupil costs expressed in terms of the average daily attendance (ADA), or the average number of students who are in attendance each day, as this measure is most frequently used by the federal government in comparing costs between districts.

Equating expenditures to a per pupil basis provides a useful starting point for examining the relative cost of providing education services across districts. However, districts are not equal in size or population mix, and this measure alone cannot be used to draw conclusions about the local effort and support for education or operating efficiencies and deficiencies. Additionally, costs of goods and services vary throughout the state, and some LEAs receive the benefit of services paid for by other county agencies.
In computing per pupil costs, it is necessary to determine which costs will be included in the calculation and which student measure will be used. Since there are many variations of includable costs and pupil measures, figures published in this report may differ from those published by another state, the federal government, or even the local education agencies in Maryland. It has been the practice of this Department to include all operating expenditures except food services, community services, adult education, equipment and current capital outlay, and payments to other public school districts and nonpublic schools.

Highlights
• The Current Expense Fund expenditures per pupil belonging at the state level increased 2.07% from $13,966 in 2015-2016 to $14,255 in 2016-2017. The Average Daily Membership (ADM) at the state level increased by 1.02% from 868,396 to 877,267.
• The Current Expense Fund expenditures per pupil belonging vary between Maryland LEAs from a high of $17,330 in Worcester County to a low of $12,579 in Talbot County.
Beginning in FY 1998, Maryland public schools were required to budget and report expenditures differently than in the past. Administration was redefined to exclude expenditures for Instructional Supervision, Facilities Acquisition, and Construction. Instruction expanded to three categories, one for Instructional Salaries and Wages, one for Textbooks and Instructional Supplies, and one for Other Instructional Costs. In addition, the three instructional categories were modified to exclude expenditures for School Administration and to include

expenditures for Staff/Curriculum Development. Mid-Level Administration, a new expenditure category, was added to

report the expenditures for Instructional Supervision and School Administration. The Capital Outlay category was modified to include the costs of Facilities Acquisition and Construction. Because of these changes, longitudinal comparisons of expenditures in these expenditure categories are not available
DEFINITIONS
Administration - expenditures for the general regulation, direction, and control of the LEA and the LEA instructional programs. Activities in this category generally involve the formulation and execution of educational or financial policy for the LEA as a whole, rather than the administration of a single building or narrow phase of school activity. The Administration category includes board of education services, office of the superintendent, community relations, business services, human resources, data processing, printing and duplicating, purchasing, legal services, planning, research and evaluation services, centralized support services, and general support services.
Average Number Belonging - the aggregate number of student days in membership divided by the number of days schools were open, adjusted for half-day prekindergarten and kindergarten programs.
Average Daily Attendance - the aggregate number of student days attended divided by the number of days schools were open, adjusted for half-day prekindergarten and prekindergarten programs.

provided by the LEA for the community or some segment of the community other than for public school activities and adult education. Included in this category are expenditures for community recreation programs, before and after school programs, and community transportation programs.
Current Expense Fund - the fund used to account for the basic operations of the LEA, comprised of the general fund and those special revenue funds available for general fund purposes. Expenditures in this fund are reported by expenditure category and object.
Debt Service Fund - the fund used to account for the payments of interest and principal on long-term general obligation debt and state loans, excluding obligations incurred by the State of Maryland for construction of public school facilities. The issuance and repayment of debt is the responsibility of the parent government, except Baltimore City. Baltimore City Public Schools had been authorized to issue bonds for cost of projects under the section 4-306.2 of the Education Article of the Annotated Code of Maryland. All Maryland LEAs are required to annually report their portion of long-term debt issued for local education purposes.
Fixed Charges - expenditures of a generally recurrent nature are not readily chargeable to other expenditure categories, such as employee benefits, rent, insurance, judgments, and other items similar in nature to this grouping.
Food Service Fund - expenditures for activities involving the preparation and serving of meals to students and adults.

Capital Outlay - expenditures of current funds for directing and managing the acquisition of, or addition to, fixed assets, including money spent for land or existing buildings, improvements to grounds, construction, remodeling, or

Health Services - expenditures for physical and mental health activities, which provide students with appropriate medical,
dental, and nurse services.

renovations. Community Services - expenditures for activities that are

Instructional Expenditure Categories - expenditures for activities that deal with teaching regular students and/or enhancing the educational experience for students.

services to prevent double accounting of expenditures between education service providers.
Teachers’ Retirement - the annual contribution to the teachers’ retirement system to support benefits of future retirees.

Maintenance of Plant - expenditures incurred to keep the grounds, buildings, and equipment in their original condition of efficiency or completeness.

Mid-Level Administration - expenditures for district-wide administration and supervision of instructional programs and for school administration.

Operation of Plant - expenditures for keeping the physical plant open and ready for use. They include cleaning services, utilities, rental of facilities, grounds maintenance, warehousing and storing services, security services, and other routine activities.

Special Education - expenditures for students who, through appropriate assessment, have been determined to have temporary or long-term special education needs arising from cognitive, emotional, and/or physical factors.

Student Activities Fund - a fund used to account for the operations of student activities that are owned, operated, and managed by the student body under the guidance and/or direction of staff members or other adults.

Student Personnel Services - expenditures for attendance services, social work services, student accounting services, etc.

Transfers - payments by one agency to another for services rendered. Transfers are differentiated from contracted

Immigration Sen. Tim Kaine tours Virginia shelter housing about 15 separated migrant children
by Nick Anderson and Marissa J. Lang June 22 Email the author About 15 migrant children recently separated from their parents near the southwestern U.S. border are staying at a shelter in Northern Virginia, according to the shelter’s leadership. Sen. Tim Kaine (D-Va.) toured the Youth for Tomorrow facility Friday in the Prince William County community of Bristow, aides said, speaking with some of the migrant children and learning from the staff that many of the youngsters arrived there “traumatized.” The children — girls from 10 to 17 years old — were taken to the shelter, according to Gary Jones, chief executive of Youth for Tomorrow, after the Trump administration began a recent, highly publicized immigration enforcement crackdown. Jones said two of the girls are expected to be reunited with their parents soon. He said he did not have additional details. [‘The only son I have’: A Guatemalan mother’s emotional reunion with her son] The administration’s “zero tolerance” approach emphasized prosecution of adults who cross the border illegally, which led to children being taken from their parents and housed in shelters, while the parents were placed in criminal detention. President Trump signed an order this week meant to end family separations at the border, although the details of implementing it remain unclear. “The Trump administration needs to assure us that every single one of the children they separated from their parents is quickly and safely returned to their families,” Kaine said in a statement. “The first step toward that goal is identifying where every child is being held, releasing a list of those facilities, and letting members of Congress visit all of those locations.”
Kaine said he was thankful that Youth for Tomorrow allowed him to visit and appreciated the organization’s efforts to reunify families. He contended that federal authorities are not being transparent about the locations where children are being kept. Jones said Youth for Tomorrow is sheltering dozens of migrant children from Honduras, Guatemala and El Salvador. Most arrived at the U.S.-Mexico border alone, he said, but about 15 had traveled with parents. “Here’s the thing that agitates some of us: Every single kid here has been separated from their families,” Jones said. “There are families that send their kids here by themselves. It’s not right that we’re separating children from their families when they come across the border, but every child they have here has been separated from their families if they’re an immigrant child. Every single one.” [The Fix: Three lessons from Trump’s immigration fiasco] At least 2,500 migrant children were separated from parents under Trump administration actions starting in early May. The federal Office of Refugee Resettlement, part of the Department of Health and Human Services, has placed many of them in shelters and foster homes around the country.Lawmakers and state officials have pressed for a detailed accounting of those arrangements, so far with limited success.
A media unit within the HHS Administration for Children and Families did not respond to an email from The Washington Post this week seeking information about the number of separated children sent to Maryland and Virginia.

Efforts to track the separated children face bureaucratic hurdles. They are being handled under the same process the government uses to shelter undocumented migrant children who come to the United States unaccompanied by parents. The Capital Area Immigrants’ Rights Coalition said four shelters in Virginia and two in Maryland are designated to receive unaccompanied migrant children. Some separated migrant children are also living in foster homes in Maryland. A spokeswoman for Maryland Gov. Larry Hogan (R) said his administration has requested information from the federal government about the placement of separated children in the state. Hogan, who withdrew a National Guard helicopter crew from the southern border this week to protest the family separations, “believes any children located in Maryland should be reunited with their families,” spokeswoman Amelia Chasse said in an email.

Jayapal Goes Inside Federal Detention Center to Meet With Asylum-Seeking Women: “The mothers could not stop crying”
June 9, 2018 | Press Release SEATTLE – Congresswoman Pramila Jayapal, member of the House Judiciary Committee, issued the following statement after demanding and being given access to the Federal Detention Center in SeaTac, Washington to look at conditions and speak with 174 immigrant women detained inside: “What I heard from the women today being held at the detention center was heartbreaking. They are there only because of the Trump administration’s cruel new ‘zero tolerance’ policies of family separation. They spoke of fleeing threats of rape, gang violence and political persecution. They spoke of their children who have been killed by gangs and their fear of being raped. The mothers could not stop crying when they spoke about their children – young girls and boys who were taken from them with no chance to say goodbye and no plan for reunification. “Of the 206 immigrants being held there, 174 are women. I spent almost three hours meeting with the women, almost all of whom are asylum seekers. They come from 16 different countries with the largest numbers from Cuba, El Salvador, Honduras and Guatemala. Over a third of the women were mothers who had been forcibly separated from their children, who range in age from 1-year-old to teenagers. The vast majority of the mothers have not spoken with their children in weeks and they have no idea where they are. Most have been held in detention for more than two weeks and many for over a month. “They should not be held in federal prison, but the women I spoke to said SeaTac is the first place they feel they’ve been treated as human beings – thanks to the standards in place at governmentowned and operated facilities, rather than the privately contracted facilities of DHS. “The women talked of being held in Border Patrol facilities that they termed the ‘dog pound,’ because of inhumane fenced cages, and the ‘ice box,’ because temperatures are frigid and detainees are given no blankets or mats. They also spoke of lack of access to food and water, and said they suffered humiliation and verbal abuse from border agents who called them ‘filthy’ and ‘stinky,’ and told them that their ‘families would not exist anymore’ and that they would “never see their children again.’

“Also extremely troubling were the accounts of mass prosecutions, where individuals were processed through the court system in groups of up to 100 at a time with no ability to speak individually to a judge.
“I call on the Trump administration to release all of these individuals immediately, to give them access to attorneys to quickly process their asylum claims, and for them to be immediately reunited with their children. It is outrageous that Department of Homeland Security is violating human rights and our international legal obligations under human rights law to swiftly and humanely process asylum seekers. I will also continue to push to defund ICE, to completely reform the immigration detention system and end mass prosecutions by the Department of Justice, and defund any Department of Homeland Security programs that break up families.
“What I saw today is simply not who, we, as a country should be. This is cruel and inhumane treatment and we cannot allow it to continue on our watch.”

It’s been 23 days since Lidia Souza has seen her son, held his hand, or hugged him good night.

The two, fleeing what Souza characterized as imminent, personal violence in their native Brazil, were separated by immigration authorities at the US-Mexico border last month.

Souza, who came to the United States seeking asylum and is now staying in Hyannis, spent weeks in detention in Texas not knowing where her son, Diogo, was being held. But then a conversation with another mother who was also being detained provided her with the kernel of information she needed to find him. The mother, also Brazilian, had been able to speak with her daughter, who was being held in Chicago. The little girl had a friend there named Diogo.

Souza, 27, got the phone number of the facility, called, and asked if her son was there. He was.

She was eventually released from detention. Her son, however, was not.

They now are allowed to speak twice a week for 10 minutes at a time. One of those calls was Monday, his ninth birthday, which they spent more than 1,000 miles apart.

Diogo is one of the more than 2 300 children who have been separated from

Guatemalan in Westboro sees the effects of separation policy firsthand

By Mark Sullivan Telegram & Gazette Staff Posted Jun 20, 2018 at 8:43 PM Updated Jun 21, 2018 at 5:51 AM
WESTBORO - Elmer Oliva came to a demonstration at the Westboro rotary Wednesday to say thanks. Demonstrators were protesting the Trump administration’s policy of separating children from their parents when they are illegally crossing the U.S. border. Mr. Oliva, 47, an immigrant seeking asylum from conditions in Guatemala, said his 17-year-old son and 9-year-old daughter arrived in Massachusetts Tuesday after having been detained with his wife, accused of illegally crossing the border from Mexico into the United States, and taken into custody under the “zero tolerance” policy. His children, Elmer Jr., 17, and Keyri, 9, had been separated for five weeks from their mother, Lubin Jimenez, 43. She remains in a detention center in Texas; the children had been sent to a detention facility in Grand Rapids, Michigan, about 1,500 miles away. “She cried a lot,” he said of his daughter. “She cried, ‘I want to go to my mother.’ ”

Mr. Oliva, a house painter, said he arrived in this country two years ago and is living in Westboro. He said his wife and children sought to escape political violence in Guatemala and join him here. He hopes his wife will be reunited with him in two or three weeks.
Mr. Oliva thanked the demonstrators for their support. “I am very happy,” Mr. Oliva said, to be reunited with his children.
On Wednesday, other local protests against separation of families were heard.
The Rev. Philip L. Boroughs, president of College of the Holy Cross, issued a statement decrying the “shameful” treatment on the southern U.S. border.
“With thousands of families displaced from their homes each day, many fleeing devastating violence, it is inconceivable that the U.S. government is compounding their misery with an ill-conceived ‘zero tolerance’ immigration policy responsible for separating children from their parents,” Rev. Boroughs said.
“This policy must end,” he said. “I am personally appalled at the use of children for the sake of achieving political goals. Even as we enforce laws, we must do so in a humane way, one which recognizes the human dignity inherent in every person, particularly those who are most vulnerable. We must meet those looking for asylum with love and empathy, not ill-intended policies that add to their suffering in the name of order.
“As Pope Francis said today, ‘A person’s dignity does not depend on them being a citizen, a migrant, or a refugee. Saving the life of someone fleeing war and poverty is an act of humanity.’
“As a community, the College of the Holy Cross lends our voice to those of Pope Francis, our fellow Jesuits, faith and political leaders of all denominations and points of view, and loving people everywhere, who have spoken out against the shameful practice of separating children from their families,” Rev. Boroughs said.

Copyright © 2018 Albuquerque Journal
SANTA TERESA – The New Mexico border region is the backdrop for the President Trump administration’s zero-tolerance policy that has separated hundreds of children from their parents in recent weeks.
In the past, most parents caught crossing the border in El Paso and New Mexico illegally who had no prior deportations or criminal charges were released with ankle monitors and allowed to remain with their children while their cases moved through the immigration courts.
Part of the reason for that tactic was a court settlement that barred the government from holding kids in detention centers longer than 20 days, even with their families.
Now, because the zero-tolerance policy calls for detaining everyone crossing illegally – regardless of whether it is their first time – parents are locked up and the children are placed in the care of the U.S. Department of Health and Human Services. HHS has had to set up temporary shelters, including several tents in Tornillo, Texas, for teenage boys to make room for younger kids at other shelters. The shelters are not considered detention centers.
New Mexico does not have any of its own shelters, so children crossing with parents in New Mexico are sent to shelters across the country.
There is no limit to how long HHS can retain custody of children although the average stay is about 50 days before children are placed with a sponsor. The federal government is required to choose family members as sponsors whenever possible, even if those relatives are undocumented.
The El Paso Border Patrol sector, which includes all of New Mexico, apprehended 7,401 people between October 2016 through May 2017. From October 2017 through May 2018, the number has fallen by 35 percent to 4,765, according to the federal government.
At the same time, there’s been a surge in families arriving at ports of entry in the region, most seeking asylum, from 4,996 in 2017 to 9,514, according to numbers just released from Customs and Border Protection.
The number of asylum seekers has overwhelmed CBP, and officers have been posted in the middle of international bridges and border crossing to screen people as they enter the U.S. to ask for asylum.

On Tuesday, officers were questioning nearly every parent with a child and asking them to show documents before proceeding to the official immigration checkpoint. Some Central American families have been turned away and asked to come back another day.
“Port of Entry facilities were not designed to hold hundreds of people at a time who may be seeking asylum,” said Roger Maier, a CBP spokesman in El Paso, in an emailed statement.
Immigrant rights organizations have said the delay in allowing people to cross the border is another effort to deter asylum seekers.
“No one is being denied the opportunity to make a claim of credible fear or seek asylum,” Maier said. “CBP officers allow more people into our facilities for processing once space becomes available or other factors allow for additional parties to arrive.”
Many asylum seekers are released while their cases move through immigration court. But asylum seekers who arrive without children increasingly are sent to detention centers.
Seeking asylum
While typically asylum seekers with children are not detained, there are reports of cases in which families seeking asylum are separated.
In at least one case, an asylum seeker crossing into New Mexico was detained and separated from a child long before the zero-tolerance policy. Maria Vandelice de Bastos showed up at the Santa Teresa border crossing with her 16-year-old disabled grandson seeking asylum 10 months ago. She hasn’t seen him since.
“She is devastated,” said immigration attorney Eduardo Beckett, who represents the 54-year-old grandmother from Brazil.
She remains in a detention center in El Paso waiting for a ruling on her asylum case from an immigration judge. Her grandson Matheus – who has severe epilepsy, neurological problems and is autistic – is at a facility in Connecticut.
“… This is what we call the criminalization of the asylum process, in my opinion, from what I’m seeing on the ground,” Beckett said.
He said Vandelice de Bastos fled her native Brazil after getting death threats when she complained about conditions at her grandson’s school that led to the firing of the principal.
“The principal happened to have a brother who was a cop, and he showed up at her doorstep,” Beckett said.
Immigrant advocacy organizations and human rights groups say the increasingly harsh measures on the border are designed to deter families seeking a safe haven in the U.S.
“This didn’t happen overnight, and it didn’t happen in the last year, it has been such an evolution of border enforcement policies,” said Johana Bencomo, community organizer for NM CAFÉ, a faith-based organization in Las Cruces.
Vandelice de Bastos’ attorney said the message from the Trump administration for families arriving on the border these days is clear.
“Don’t come here,” Beckett said. “Don’t apply for asylum. Go home.”
Hundreds protest
New Mexicans were among hundreds of demonstrators who showed up outside the El Paso Immigration Detention Center on Tuesday for a protest against family separation. The protest was organized by the

Border Network for Human Rights. Protesters also chanted “free the children” outside the nearby Border Patrol Headquarters.
U.S. Department of Homeland Security Secretary Kirstjen Nielsen defended the controversial zerotolerance policy.
“The border is being overrun by those who have no right to cross it,” she said.
“As long as illegal entry remains a criminal offense, DHS will no longer look the other way,” Nielsen said.
The other alternative is “just let the entire family walk, in which case you’re very unlikely to see them again if they don’t have a valid claim,” said Ira Melman, a spokesman for Americans for Immigration Reform, an organization that advocates for a tighter border controls and lower levels of legal immigration. “They’re just going to game the system.”

By Kelly Heyboer and Erin Banco | NJ Advance Media for NJ.com Twenty immigrant children have arrived in New Jersey within the past 30 days since the implementation of President Trump’s “zero tolerance policy,” including three who were separated from their parents at the border, according to a social services agency based in Camden. A spokeswoman for Center for Family Services, Jen Hammill, said the other 17 children were unaccompanied minors, but she did not not provide their ages or the location of the shelters in South Jersey.
Overall, she said, the agency is currently housing a total of 27 children with the majority housed in one facility and the others in a separate location that includes parents and guardians. She added that over the past year the agency has housed a total of 90 children, the vast majority crossing the border as unaccompanied minors. "Family reunification is our primary goal," Hammill said. "Center For Family Services takes steps to reunite children with their families and to develop a plan for a safe and healthy future for each child." In the past few weeks, thousands of children have been separated from their parents at the U.S.-Mexico border and sent to facilities across the country. A national outcry has ensued over the past few days as media outlets have published photos of children being held in cage-like structures in facilities in Texas. However, on Wednesday, President Donald Trump signed an executive order ending his administration's controversial policy of separating immigrant children from their parents if they are caught illegally crossing the border. The new order does not end Trump's "zero-tolerance" policy on immigrants caught entering the U.S. illegally and raises a new set of questions about how the government will handle children and families in detention moving forward. The policy could have a big impact on New Jersey, which has one of the largest immigrant populations in the country and continues to rank as one of the top destinations for immigrant children detained while crossing the border alone.

The $4 million contract The Center for Family Services has a $4 million contract with the U.S. Department of Health and Human Services to house immigrant children, federal officials said. The agency has a series of homes and facilities where children are placed temporarily. Hammill said the Center for Family Services needs families in South Jersey to take in children. Before the government began separating immigrant children from their parents, the shelter was mostly used to house immigrant children and teenagers who crossed into the U.S. on their own. A spokesman for the U.S. Department of Health and Human Services declined to say if there are any other facilities in New Jersey housing immigrant children. "For the safety and security of minors in the unaccompanied alien children program, we do not identify specific shelters or children in the program," said Kenneth Wolfe, U.S. Department of Health and Human Services.

What does Trump's new order say? The new executive order signed Wednesday stops immigrant families from being split up into separate facilities when they are detained at the border.
“I didn’t like the sight or the feeling of families being separated,” Trump said, reversing his previous position.
However, the order shifts the policy to one of "family detention," so families will be detained together. The order has no direction for how the more than 2,000 children who have already been separated from their parents will be reunited with their families. But federal officials said they are working on a plan to return children to their parents.

Will shelters start housing immigrant families under Trump's new order?

Questions remain about whether the current system can handle detaining large numbers of

immigrant families waiting for their cases to be heard. Under the previous system, families

were often released and given a court date to return for their hearing, though many did not

show up.

Under the Obama administration, children could only be held in immigration detention for 20

days or less. The federal government already has little room for the families currently in custody at the border and has began using some federal prisons to house immigrants in detention. It is unclear if they will begin sending immigrant families to facilities in other states, including New Jersey, if there is a backlog.
Are some immigrant children still being separated from their parents? Though Trump's order stops the separation of children and parents at the border, immigrant children are still losing their parents in New Jersey because of increasing arrests by Immigration and Customs Enforcement agents, immigration advocates said. Arrests by ICE agents in New Jersey jumped 42 percent in fiscal year 2017 after the Trump administration increased its crackdown on illegal immigration. In many cases the children of immigrant parents in detention stay with relatives. In some cases, they are taken to shelters for unaccompanied minors. "Although many of these forced family separations are happening in Texas, it is an issue for New Jersey, too. The immigration detention facility in Elizabeth also houses parents who have been separated from their children while the parent awaits immigration proceedings," said Cecilia Zalkind, president and chief executive officer of Advocates for Children of New Jersey, a non-profit group. "As a mother and grandmother, I understand what we all innately know – that a child needs their parents and family. No matter where they live, children should not be a bargaining chip. Their protection must be a priority for all of us," Zalkind said. Immigration advocates have held protests at the immigration detention center in Elizabeth, including one of Father's Day, to highlight that immigrant children are being separated from their parents every day without the publicity the issue has gotten at the U.S.-Mexico border.

How will Trump's new order affect kids who illegally cross the border without their parents?

New Jersey remains one of the top states where the federal Office of Refugee Resettlement sends children who cross into the U.S. illegally without their parents.

Last year, 2,300 of those children were sent to live with "sponsor" families, usually

1

relatives or close friends, in New Jersey while the kids await deportation hearings. They

range in age from babies to 17 year olds.

That sponsor family system is not expected to change under Trump's new executive order.

Union, Hudson and Bergen counties were the top destinations for the unaccompanied immigrant children last year, according to federal statistics.

An escalation in immigration enforcement over the past year has brought a new level of anxiety for the several thousand migrant farm workers living in Vermont. For the first time since 2010, arrests and detentions (https://www.cbp.gov/newsroom/local-media-release/cbp-announces-fy17-bordersecurity-statistics-new-england) by the U.S. Border Patrol increased in Vermont, New Hampshire and northeastern New York last year. The workers – many of them undocumented – are critically important to the state’s farm economy. To give you a sense of how important, consider that twice a year the Mexican government comes (http://digital.vpr.net/post/mexican-consulate-coming-

middlebury-saturday#stream/0) to a Vermont farm community to help hundreds of its citizens with financial and legal advice, and to issue passports and other government documents.

About 140 mostly undocumented workers turned out at a church meeting hall in Middlebury on a recent Saturday to share a warm meal with friends and to meet with their government officials.

Jose Aguilar had come over from New Hampshire to renew his passport. Our interpreter, Chris Urban, asked him when he wants to head home to Mexico. Aguilar laughs. “Tomorrow morning,” he said, “because it will be late today.”

Aguilar – who likes to practice his English

not going home. And when asked why he’s

in New England, and he gave the same

answer as the other workers here.

“I work on the farm with the cows,” he said. “Just working, and working hard!”

Aguilar slipped back to Spanish as he talks about how living conditions for his family in Mexico, their housing – even their basic nutrition — has improved with the remittances he sends home.

“Yes," he said.

"The sacrifice is worth it because here we can achieve what we could never achieve in Mexico." — dairy worker Jose Aguilar

So the work is steady, the pay helps their families. But most of the farm workers interviewed in Middlebury said the stress of living while undocumented has increased over the last year. Felipe – who did not want his last name used — works on a large dairy farm in Bristol with about a dozen other Mexicans. “Because of Trump’s immigration laws, one walks around with a bit more fear and is a bit more nervous to leave the house and go out,” he said. Julia Doucet, a nurse with the Open Door (http://opendoormidd.org/) clinic in Addison County, was coordinating free health screenings for the migrants at the Middlebury meeting. She said the increased stress can affect physical and mental health.

"Chronic stress and anxiety definitely has a direct correlation to poor health outcomes,” she said. “When your nervous system is at that high alert all the time, you can have trouble sleeping, you can have depression, some serious anxiety, and all those play into both negative health and negative mental health.”
Doucet said the clinic recently surveyed about 100 migrant workers to gauge their current level of stress over the past year.
"80 percent of the people that we interviewed felt either more scared, or a lot more scared, more anxious or a lot more anxious about going out in public places." — Julia Doucet, the Open Door clinic
“And that was one of the questions that we had, is how has the new administration has affected their level of stress, their anxiety, and their fear, and their sadness,” she said.
“And we found that pretty much 80 percent of the people that we interviewed felt either more scared, or a lot more scared, more anxious or a lot more anxious about going out in public places, and doing social events; and they were somewhat more anxious about getting health care as well.”
On a farm with sweeping views of the Adirondacks to the west and the Green Mountains to the east, dairy farmer Rob Hunt is focused on a broken piece of machinery, but also the fate of his workforce.
He was working on a “silage facer” when I caught up to him. It’s device that uses metal teeth to chew through piles of feed to expose a fresh layer for the cows.
“That’s pretty hard, and this machine works,” he said. “And like anything, it wears out.”
Hunt admitted he’s much more passionate about his cows than his machinery. And he said the Mexicans he’s hired over the last decade to milk and care for his herd have been crucial to the success of his West Addison, Vermont, farm.
So he’s worried about them getting stopped or deported.

“For me, I work with these guys every day. I know where they’re from. How many kids they have. I know a lot about them,” he said. “So I’m concerned about what happens to them, their safety and security. But also, if they swoop in and they clean out my workforce, my wife and I can’t run this place by ourselves. So, yeah, the concern is real.”
"I'm concerned about what happens to them, their safety and security. But also, if they swoop in and they clean out my workforce, my wife and I can't run this place by ourselves." — Rob Hunt, dairy farmer
Hunt said the best solution would be some sort of guest worker program that would allow people to be here legally.
He said he pays his workers as much or more than Americans, if you include the housing, TV, utilities and transportation he provides. But he can’t find U.S. workers to fill the positions:
“There’s always a shortage of American labor on farms," Hunt explains. "Our day starts at 2:30 in the morning. And that eliminates about 75 percent of the American population right there.”
Add the fact cows have to be milked 365 days a year, in conditions that can be hot, cold, muddy and smelly: “And that pretty much eliminates the last 5 percent of the American population,” he said.
Like Hunt, Jose Aguilar, who’s been waiting for his new passport at the Middlebury mobile consulate, would also like to see Mexican workers be able to come here under a guest worker permit. That way, he could travel back and forth to Mexico to see his family without fear.
And to the question of if he's taking a job that an American would want?
“I don’t think so,” he said. “It’s hard because sometimes we need to work in the night. And some Americans, they can’t do that. It’s a lot of hours, like 12, 14 a day; sometimes [we] don’t have a day off. I think they can do it for a few days, but after a while they would be broke up.”

He laughed at his own observation. “That’s funny but it’s true.”
Aguilar said if he could talk to people making the immigration laws, he would tell them most immigrants are not criminals or bad people. They just want the opportunity to support a family and live a normal life.

“I came to Vermont when I was 19 years old and I’m 38 years old. It’s just about half my life. So of course, I’m thinking: Should I just stay?” he said. “I hope to God no one comes to get us or deport us. I’ve been here a long time.”

Migrant children separated from parents start to arrive in Minnesota
Separated from parents at the border, kids find advocates in strangers.
By Chris Serres (http://www.startribune.com/chris-serres/10645926/) and Mary Lynn Smith (http://www.startribune.com/mary-lynn-smith/10645991/) Star Tribune staff writers
JUNE 23, 2018 — 8:10PM
Alison Griffith recalls feeling stunned by the small size of the 8-year-old girl from Guatemala who walked into her immigration law office in Minneapolis.
With her tiny feet dangling from a high-backed chair, the girl, who was accompanied by an aunt, calmly recounted how immigration officers at the U.S.-Mexican border had separated her from her father, who was later deported to Guatemala.
“It was the most traumatic moment in this young girl’s life, and she described it like it happened yesterday,” said Griffith, a staff attorney with the Advocates for Human Rights, a Minneapolis nonprofit that represents the girl.
The child, whose family declined to disclose her name for safety reasons, is among a small number of unaccompanied migrant children who have arrived in Minnesota since the federal government began taking a harder line against illegal border crossings. Recent arrivals also include a 7-year-old boy separated from his parents who were fleeing violence and poverty in Guatemala.
They are among the first in an expected surge of unaccompanied minors, forcibly removed from their parents, who are now making their way to distant relatives in Minnesota and surrounding states. It is unclear how many of the children will end up in Minnesota, but immigration law experts say the numbers could reach into the dozens by this fall.
Even as President Donald Trump signed an executive order Wednesday ending his policy of separating parents and children who have crossed the border illegally, the fallout from the border crackdown has already spread to other states, which are seeing an influx of unaccompanied migrant children being placed by federal authorities.
“As long as there is a crisis at the border, those numbers [of unaccompanied minors arriving in Minnesota] will continue to go up,” said Linus Chan, a University of Minnesota law professor who leads the campus Detainee Rights Clinic (https://www.law.umn.edu/course/7844/detainee-rights-clinic) , which represents immigrants facing removal and being detained in the Twin Cities.

‘Layers of trauma’
The cases of unaccompanied migrant children present unique challenges for legal advocates.
Sarah Brenes, director of the refugee and immigrant program at Advocates for Human Rights, said children who are fleeing their home countries have already suffered “layers of trauma,” even before being separated from their parents. At times, lawyers for Advocates for Human Rights will encourage children to draw pictures of what has happened to them and their families if it’s too difficult for them to talk about their experiences. It can also help attorneys piece together a chronological account that can be presented to an asylum officer.
Many of the children may be eligible for asylum, but they are so desperate to return to their parents and families that they will insist on returning to their home countries, even if that means returning to the violent conditions they fled, say legal advocates who have represented migrant children.
“So many of these children, they just want their parents,” said Margaret Russell, managing attorney at the Immigration Law Project at Mid-Minnesota Legal Aid. “They really, really, really want to be reunited with their families.”
The Advocates for Human Rights currently represents two unrelated young children from Guatemala forcibly removed from their parents after crossing the U.S.-Mexican border. The children are now living with relatives in Minnesota. One of them is a 7-year-

old boy who fled desperate poverty, which prevented him from having adequate access to food or being able to attend school. He is living with his aunt and attending school in
The other child, the 8-year-old girl, has indicated that she wants to return to her family in Guatemala and does not want to remain in the United States, said attorneys with Advocates for Human Rights. At one point, attorneys arranged a telephone call between the girl and her father in Guatemala, who both described being separated by immigration officers at the border, said Griffith, their attorney.
The father “begged the officer to be able to stay with his child. He was crying. She was crying,” Griffith said. “It was very heartbreaking to see this kid tear up as she described it.”
She added, “We can’t treat children as little adults. They aren’t little adults.”
In order to stem the flow of migrants, the Trump administration in April announced a “zero tolerance” policy on illegal border crossings. The hard-line policy led to an immediate spike in prosecutions and, as a result, an increase in family separations. In just seven weeks, more than 2,300 children have been taken from their parents at the U.S.-Mexico border, resulting in an influx of young children requiring placement and government care.
But even before the zero-tolerance policy, Minnesota saw an increase in unaccompanied migrant children, propelled north by gang violence, poverty and widespread abuses in Central America.
“It’s clear that the violence and the economic hardship in Central America are a driving factor in what’s happening,” said Chan of the U. “It was true in 2014 and it’s true in 2018.”
‘No other choice’
Maria Celeste Delcid was 15 when she said she had little choice but to leave her family and flee violence in Guatemala. She had been forced to marry a man who threatened to kill her family and later beat her. The Guatemalan authorities gave her no help.
“I got pregnant and he didn’t want the baby, and he beat me,” Delcid, who lives in the Twin Cities, said through an interpreter.
Her father found relatives in another town to hide her until she could find a way to the United States, where an aunt lived in Minnesota. They bore the grief of separating.
“There was no other choice,” said Delcid, who in 2011 joined others fleeing the gang members who recruited young boys, raped girls and women and extorted money from families amid death threats.
The journey was dangerous and arduous. Days in the desert were hot, the nights cold. She and the others were hungry and exhausted, sleeping little along the way. Delcid remembers the rugged terrain, the cactus needles they bumped into at night and the fear of being raped by the smugglers who guided them.
Crossing illegally into the United States, Delcid, now 21, said she requested asylum and was held by immigration authorities for four months before she joined relatives in Minnesota. She eventually would like to legally bring her father, three sisters and brother to the United States, sparing them the unforgiving journey she and many others endured.
Watching news reports of immigrant children being taken from their families and knowing the process for asylum is being made more difficult, Delcid feels sadness.
Those who blame the parents for crossing illegally need to understand that these families want a better life for their children, she said.
“They have no choice,” said Delcid. “Even if you build a wall, they will find a way to get in.”

Two city public hospitals have treated 12 young immigrant children who were separated from their parents at the border for physical and mental illnesses, Health and Hospitals CEO Mitchell Katz said Thursday.
∠
The children were brought to the hospitals — four to Bellevue in Manhattan and eight to North Central Bronx Hospital — after being placed with foster parents by area social service organizations tasked with caring for the children, he said.
∠
“There are undoubtedly many more, since our commitment is to serving people, not interrogating them about the circumstances that bring them to our facilities,” Katz said.
∠
The children they have seen have presented with depression, anxiety, asthma, constipation and other ailments, city officials said. One was suicidal, Katz said, something he said did not surprise him given the circumstances. “I donF’tRfEinEdTtRhIaAtLdramaHTtiRcuYrwrhy3e,FonRfIfEetEhr ieMnnkOdasNb6oT/uH2t7Sm!y own children, trying to imagine what it would have felt like to them to be separated from me forcibly,” he said.

The children appeared in hospitals over the last two weeks and it was only when their number mounted that they realized what was happening, Katz said. He said he was made aware of the situation two days ago.

The city does not currently have access to facilities of Cayuga Centers or other providers to offer on-site mental health services.

“The children that we’re seeing are being brought in by loving foster families who are struggling to take care of these children, who the families know themselves have been traumatized by the experience,” Katz said.

But the city is looking to gain access to children in temporary shelters, too.
“The city is reaching out to the main foster care providers hosting these children to discuss and expedite health services,” Deputy Mayor Herminia Palacio said. “We will work with providers to help them take care of these children.”
Many New Yorkers are wondering how they can help, Mayor de Blasio’s wife, Chirlane McCray, said.

“You can donate,” she said. “The Mayor’s Fund to Advance New York City will donate $10,000 to purchase affinity objects that can help children cope with trauma, items like teddy bears.”

McCray, the fund’s chairwoman, said donations can be made at nyc.gov/fund.

She also encouraged New Yorkers to call their elected officials to demand a permanent end to such separation.

“They need to hear from us, believe me these calls make a huge difference,” she said.

De Blasio, who traveled Thursday to the southern border, told NY1 the city would also set up ways to help through 311.

“We’re going to set up through 311 a system where if people want to offer any kind of support that would help these kids that they’ll have a way to do that,” he said, adding he hoped it would be up and running by Friday.

And Councilman Mark Levine (D-Manhattan) launched a drive for supplies for the

children — and his office was promptly overflowing with things like diapers and

clothing. One person even offered to donate frozen breast milk, his office said. The

A spokesman for the department of Health and Human Services said this happens for a variety of reasons including:
A lack of space Available shelter accommodations Demographics of the children Proximity to potential sponsors
“There’s an effort to place them as closely as possible to where they’re going to be eventually reunified with a sponsor or a family member,” the spokesman said, adding that it is “pretty rare” that someone would be sent to New York if it’s only because of space.
If a child goes to New York, that usually means there’s an immediate family member in the New York facility, the spokesman explained.
HHS does not have a publicly accessible database to track children. The spokesman said lawyers and case workers are determining locations likely by pulling state licenses and going shelter by shelter to figure it out, as sources have also described to CNN.

Congressman who visited migrant detention center: We saw "a lot of kids in cages"
Rep. Peter Welch, a Democrat from Vermont, recently visited a migrant holding faculty near the US southern border. He made the trip with other US lawmakers to see firsthand the conditions in the shelters.
Welch said the facility was clean, but had no windows. It was filled with chain-link fences "that in effect, are cages," he said. Immigrants were separated by age and gender.

"What we saw was a lot of kids in cages."
He then described the scene the stood out to him the most:
"One incident really stood out in my mind. It was three boys, and I assume they were brothers, and they’re on these thin mats that are provided. And like spoon style, they're holding on to each other for dear life with no idea where their parents were. So that’s a pretty searing sight."

President Bill Clinton told an audience in Chicago on Thursday that President Donald Trump’s child separation policy was “wrong” and “immoral.”
“Taking these kids away from their parents makes no sense,” he said. “It’s wrong. It’s immoral. It’s not required by the law. And it’s not necessary to protect the border. It’s just wrong.”
He added: “Children should not be bargaining chips. They are people…I not only want this to stop, I want them to go get these kids that have already been sent away and give them back to their parents and do it right now.”
Clinton is on his book tour for “The President Is Missing,” a work of fiction he wrote with James Patterson.
The interview was with Bob Barnett, a longtime lawyer for the Clintons who has negotiated most – if not all – of their book deals.

New York City Mayor Bill de Blasio sent a letter to Health and Human Services Secretary Alex Azar, requesting information about the children sent to New York after being separated from their parents at the US southern border.
De Blasio said he is “deeply concerned” for the health and safety of the children. He asked for information on how the government “will bring these families back together, and a deadline for accomplishing that task.”
Why the New York City mayor is involved with the border crisis: At least 239 migrant children who were separated from their families are in the care of Cayuga Centers in Harlem, De Blasio said. The children include a 9-month-old. Some of the kids have bed bugs, lice, chicken pox and other contagious diseases.
De Blasio tweeted a copy of the full letter he sent to Azar:

About 500 children reunited with parents, officials say
From CNN's Tal Kopan
US Customs and Border Protection says about 500 children have been reunified with their parents. At least 2,300 migrant kids had been separated from their parents after crossing the border under President Trump's "zero-tolerance" immigration policy.
Trump signed an executive order on Wednesday to stop family separations, but it did not address how officials would reunite children who had already been separated from their parents.
Here's the full statement from Pete Ladowicz, with Customs and Border Protection:
The Administration continues to work to reunify prosecuted parents with their children. U.S. Customs and Border Protection has unified approximately 500 children (over 15%) with their parents who had been referred for prosecution for illegal entry. U.S. Immigration and Customs Enforcement and Health and Human Services are developing a process to be centered at ICE’s Port Isabel Detention Center to continue unification efforts.

Trump: "Republicans should stop wasting their time on immigration" until after the midterms
As House Republicans continue to work on their comprehensive immigration bill, Trump has some different advice: Stop until after the November midterms.
The President has repeatedly, and falsely, blamed the Democrats for the border crisis. Now, he's urging Republicans to stop working with their Democratic colleagues and instead wait for a bigger GOP majority.
Here's his tweet:
It was the third in a series of tweets blaming the "obstructionist" Democrats for blocking immigration reform. (Although, not even all of the Republicans are united on the issue).

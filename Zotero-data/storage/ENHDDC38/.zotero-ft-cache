Defendants.

9 Pursuant to LCR 3(g)(1), the State of Washington hereby submits this notice of a
10
11 pending, related case in the Western District of Washington. The related case is Padilla et al. v.

12 US Immigration and Customs Enforcement et al., 2:18-cv-00928, assigned to Presiding Judge

13 Marsha J. Pechman. That case challenges the same family separation policy and course of conduct

14 that forms the gravamen of this Action, and involves substantially the same Defendant federal
15 agencies and officers.
16 While the Plaintiffs, claims, and remedies are not coextensive between the two cases, it
17 18 is likely that there will be significant overlap in legal argument and potentially similar evidence
19 across the two actions. It appears very likely that there would be an unduly burdensome

20 duplication of labor and expense or the potential for conflicting results if the cases were conducted

21 before different judges. 22

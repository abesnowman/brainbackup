American Academy of Family Physicians Statement Regarding the United States Department of Homeland Security’s Policy to Separate Children from Adult Caregivers
The American Academy of Family Physicians opposes the forced separation of children from their families or caregivers during border crossings unless the child’s immediate physical or emotional health or safety is at risk. While the AAFP is aware of the Department of Homeland Security’s “zero-tolerance” policy, we also recognize and appreciate the gravity of the long-term harm that can be caused by forced separation at this critical and stressful time for a family. Once on American soil, regardless of their citizenship status, migrating children are the concern of the American Academy of Family Physicians. This stance is consistent with our policies on Providing Medical Care to Undocumented Persons, Reporting Residency Status of Patients, and the Family Physician's Creed. We stand with our fellow medical societies in urging the federal government to withdraw its policy of requiring separation of migrating children from their caregivers, and instead, give priority to supporting families and protecting the health and well-being of the children within those families.

AMA Urges Administration To Withdraw “Zero Tolerance” Policy
For immediate release: Jun 20, 2018

CHICAGO – The American Medical Association (AMA) today released the following letter that was sent to the Trump Administration urging the federal government to withdraw its “zero tolerance” policy that is separating migrating families from their parents and caregivers. The letter was sent to DHS Secretary Kirstjen Nielsen, HHS Secretary Alex Azar and Attorney General Jeff Sessions.
The full text of the letter is below. Download a PDF copy of the letter.
Dear Secretary Nielsen, Secretary Azar, and Attorney General Sessions:
On behalf of the physician and medical student members of the American Medical Association (AMA), I am writing to strongly urge the federal government to withdraw its “zero tolerance” policy that requires the separation of migrating children from their parents or caregivers. Instead, we urge the Administration to give priority to supporting families and protecting the health and well-being of the children within those families.
The Administration’s “zero tolerance” policy was a topic recently discussed at the AMA’s Annual Meeting, which includes delegates representing over 170 state and national specialty medical societies. During this meeting we heard from delegates that the Administration’s policy will do great harm to children and their parents or caregivers, who felt compelled to make a dangerous and uncertain journey because of safety concerns in their own countries. Families seeking refuge in the U.S. already endure emotional and physical stress, which is only exacerbated when they are

separated from one another. It is well known that childhood trauma and adverse childhood experiences created by inhumane treatment often create negative health impacts that can last an individual’s entire lifespan. Therefore, the AMA believes strongly that, in the absence of immediate physical or emotional threats to the child’s well-being, migrating children should not be separated from their parents or caregivers.
We urge you to take prompt action on this matter.
Sincerely, James L. Madara, MD

American children are separated from their parents when the parents commit a crime. Illegal immigrants need to be aware that U.S. laws will apply to them if they come across our borders. Your feelings don't overrule our laws. #LiberalHypocrisy

The parents are seeking asylum (not a crime). When US citizens commit a crime, they're children can be left with a friend, another parent or relative. The parents know where their children are and when and under what conditions they can get them back.

Unaccompanied Alien Children Released to Sponsors By State
Published: June 30, 2017

When a child who is not accompanied by a parent or legal guardian is apprehended by immigration authorities, the child is transferred to the care and custody of the Office of Refugee Resettlement (ORR) in HHS’ Administration for Children and Families. HHS’ primary legal authority is to temporarily house, feed, provide medical care and then safely release UAC to sponsors (usually family members), while they await immigration proceedings.

Sponsors are adults who are suitable to provide for the child’s physical and mental well-being and have not engaged in any activity that would indicate a potential risk to the child. All sponsors must pass a background check. The sponsor must agree to ensure the child’s presence at all future immigration proceedings. They also must agree to ensure the minor reports to ICE for removal from the United States if an immigration judge issues a removal order or voluntary departure order.

HHS is engaging with state officials to address concerns they may have about the care or impact of UAC in their states, while making sure the children are treated humanely and consistent with the law as they go through immigration court proceedings that will determine whether they will be removed and repatriated, or qualify for some form of relief.

HHS has strong policies in place to ensure the privacy and safety of UAC by maintaining the confidentiality of their personal information. These children may have histories of abuse or may be seeking safety from threats of violence. Many have been trafficked or smuggled. HHS cannot release information about individual UAC that could compromise the child’s location or identity.

The data in the table below shows state-by-state data of unaccompanied alien children released to sponsors as of April 30, 2018. ACF will update this data each month. NOTE: Data does not specifically reflect referrals from the U.S. Department of Homeland Security’s recently enacted 100 percent prosecution policy of illegal immigration cases.

Please note: ORR makes considerable effort to provide precise and timely data to the public, but adjustments occasionally occur following review and reconciliation. The FY2014 release data posted in the chart below were updated on March 13, 2015. The FY2015 release data were updated May 9, 2016. Questions may be addressed to ORR directly, at (202) 401-9246.

Helping Traumatized Children Learn

Helping Traumatized Children Learn marks a major milestone in child advocacy. Based on evidence from brain research, child development, and actual classrooms, here is a road map for parents, schools, administrators, and policy makers that shows concrete and feasible steps for making schools the life raft for children who otherwise may be misunderstood and abandoned by the community. 
— Martha L. Minow, Professor of Law, Harvard Law School
Helping Traumatized Children Learn opens up the conversation on how to best help the students who have been victims or witnesses of violence. Removing their roadblocks can give them the opportunity to be active and enthusiastic learners.

Children Learn
supportive school environments for children traumatized by family violence
A Report and Policy Agenda

Helping Traumatized Children Learn is a useful and timely report. [It] lists practical steps that educators can take to recognize signs of trauma and help children who are affected by it. The report encourages state and local officials, educators, community leaders, parents, and experts in prevention and treatment to work together for the benefit of all children. The Massachusetts Department of Education will continue to work in partnership with others to achieve these important goals.
— David P. Driscoll, Massachusetts Commissioner of Education

I endorse the recommendations in Helping Traumatized Children Learn and invite the Commonwealth’s leaders to join this powerful effort to help all children, including those who have been exposed to family violence, reach their highest potentials.
— T om Scott, Executive Director Massachusetts Association of School Superintendents

Helping Traumatized Children Learn thoroughly documents the impact of the trauma of family violence on children’s ability to learn and succeed in school. The report makes a strong case for increased resources for schools and support for teachers who work with this vulnerable population. These resources are an important investment in the future of children and in the future of our communities. Let’s hope that legislators and policy makers invest in these resources.

Preface
Helping Traumatized Children Learn is the result of an extraordinary collaboration among educators, parents, mental health professionals, community groups, and attorneys determined to help children experiencing the traumatic effects of exposure to family violence succeed in school.
Years of case work, coalition building, and policy analysis lie behind this report, which stands in the proud tradition of other reports produced by Massachusetts Advocates for Children. These reports have led to significant improvements in the lives of children in the areas of special education, bilingual education, child nutrition, lead-poisoning prevention, and others.
Susan Cole, the leader of the collaboration and this report’s principal author, is an attorney who had previously been a teacher. She melded her deep understanding of the classroom with her uncompromising standards of advocacy on behalf of children to produce this dynamic and interdisciplinary synthesis of theory, practice, and policy.
In 1998, as head of the Children’s Law Support Project, Susan collaborated with Jacquelynne Bowman, who was then at Massachusetts Law Reform Institute, to form the Task Force on Children Affected by Domestic Violence. Clinical psychologist Dr. Jessica Greenwald O’Brien, attorney Ray Wallace, school psychologist Joel Ristuccia, and others soon joined to form the Schools Working Group of the Task Force, with Susan as its chair. The group addressed the need for trauma-sensitive approaches in schools and legislation to implement them. With Geron Gadd, a Harvard Divinity School student as staff researcher and writer, a strong early draft of Helping Traumatized Children Learn was created. It was enriched over the next several years through multiple discussions with parents, educators, psychology and language experts, and domestic violence experts.

The Schools Working Group wrote articles, conducted trainings, and advocated successfully under the leadership of State Representative Alice Wolf of Cambridge, Massachusetts, for a legislative budget line item offering grants to help schools become trauma-sensitive. Two schools in Cambridge and Lynn, Massachusetts, piloted various aspects of what became known as the Flexible Framework, sharing their successes and challenges with the Group. In 2004, supported by a broad constituency, the legislature made the line item into a section of the Massachusetts Education Reform Act. We are particularly pleased that several of the recipients of this grant program are working to adapt the Framework to fit the unique needs of the many schools in their districts. Their experiences are deepening our understanding and furthering the Framework’s continuous evolution.
Through a partnership with Harvard Law School and its Hale and Dorr Legal Services Center, the work continued to develop under the auspices of the Trauma and Learning Policy Initiative (TLPI) in 2004. Michael Gregory, an attorney and recipient of a Skadden Fellowship joined the TLPI staff and using his expertise in research, writing, and policy analysis contributed significantly to giving Helping Traumatized Children Learn its final form.
A strong and growing constituency is now in place to support this groundbreaking policy initiative designed to help further the goals of education reform. The release of Helping Traumatized Children Learn was the culmination of many years of research analysis and policy development. TLPI’s mobilization campaign continues to advocate to implement the policy agenda and spread this information to every school district in Massachusetts and beyond.

Executive Summary

The goal of Helping Traumatized Children Learn is to ensure that children traumatized by exposure to family violence succeed in school. Research now shows that trauma can undermine children’s ability to learn, form relationships, and function appropriately in the classroom. Schools, which are significant communities for children, and teachers—the primary role models in these communities—must be given the supports they need to address trauma’s impact on learning. Otherwise, many children will be unable to achieve their academic potential, and the very laudable goals of education reform will not be realized. Trauma-sensitive school environments benefit all children— those whose trauma history is known, those whose trauma will never be clearly identified, and those who may be impacted by their traumatized classmates. Together, we can ensure that all children will be able to achieve at their highest levels despite whatever traumatic circumstances they may have endured.

This report proposes an educational and policy agenda that will enable schools to become supportive environments in which traumatized children can focus, behave appropriately, and learn. It translates complex research on trauma into educational terms that are useful to teachers and schools. And it provides a Flexible Framework—which can be adapted by any school—for creating a climate in which children exposed to family violence can achieve at their highest levels.1

This report proposes an educational and policy agenda that will enable schools to become
supportive environments in which traumatized children can focus, behave appropriately, and learn.

Children’s exposure to family violence is a widespread problem. A National Child Traumatic Stress Network (NCTSN) survey found that interpersonal victimization primarily in the home was the most prevalent form of trauma among children treated by Network mental health professionals.2 Studies estimate that between 3.3 million and 10 million children in the U.S. witness violence in their own homes each year.3 In 2003, approximately 906,000 children were found by child protective agencies to be victims of child abuse or neglect.4 In Massachusetts, a study by the Office of the

2 Helping Traumatized Children Learn

Commissioner of Probation reported that approximately 43,000 children were named on restraining orders, which suggests that these children were affected by family violence.5

Even these large figures appear to represent only a fraction of the problem. The 1998 Adverse Childhood Experiences study, which sent standardized questionnaires to 13,494 adult members of a large HMO, found that 44 percent of respondents reported suffering sexual, physical, or psychological abuse as children, and 12.5 percent reported having a mother who had been treated violently.6 In June 2005, the Massachusetts Department of Education presented information from informal surveys of 450 students who attended alternativeeducation programs in eleven school districts that received state-funded Alternative Education Grants (see Appendix A). The nonvalidated results of the surveys indicated that 90 percent of the students reported histories of trauma exposure, with a number of these students reporting exposure to more than one type of trauma. Of the students surveyed, 41 percent reported histories of family violence; 46 percent reported having been physically, emotionally, or sexually abused; 39 percent reported neglect; and 16 percent were living in foster care or out-ofhome placements.7

from other sources as well. When there is family violence, home is not the safe haven it is for most children. Adults who should be relied upon for nurturance may actually be a source of terror, or they may be victims themselves and unable to provide protection.8 When the perpetrator of violence is a caregiver—the person in whom a child has placed great trust and upon whom the child’s very life depends—the betrayal a child experiences can be devastating.9 The impact on a child’s selfperception10 and worldview11 can get carried into the classroom, where it can interfere with the ability

to process information and maintain control over

behaviors and emotions. The fact that family violence is frequently kept secret from schools adds to the confusion, often making it difficult for educators to discern the reasons for a child’s behavioral and learning problems.
We use the term “domestic violence” to describe violence between intimate partners. Children may have watched or overheard violence between their caregivers and may live with its consequences (e.g., maternal depression or a parent with physical injuries, such as bruises). Children may also become directly involved in a violent event by trying to stop the abuse or by calling the police.12
We include in the term “family violence” three forms of harm to children: witnessing domestic violence, being the direct victim of abuse, and being exposed to neglectful caretaking. Domestic violence, abuse, and neglect frequently occur together.13 Each of these experiences can result in similar symptoms and undermine many of the same developmental foundations.14 Analyzing them separately is enormously difficult.15 We also recognize that familial alcoholism often occurs along with family violence and that children in homes where there is substance abuse may exhibit symptoms similar to children exposed to family violence.16
Traumatized children do not fit neatly into any single “box.” Although many children enter school each day carrying with them the experience of exposure to violence in the home, the symptoms of their trauma can be quite varied, as the actual experiences of the following children illustrate:17
Tyrone
Six-year-old Tyrone was the terror of his first-grade class. He pinched, hit, and refused to obey the teacher. Frustrated with his unprovoked aggressive behavior, the school began holding suspension hearings. At home and at church, however, he was a different child, clinging to his sister and mother. He would often wake up with nightmares and a bed that was wet. Tyrone had fled with his mother, brother, and sister from a father who had abused them. To Tyrone, school felt threatening, rather than being the place of refuge he needed.

Marla
Fifteen-year-old Marla was an extremely bright student with an IQ of 139. She did not have problems with aggression. Instead, she stared out the window. She didn’t do her homework. She seemed to barely be there at all. Despite her intelligence, she was failing in school because of frequent absences. Her teachers wondered how a child with so much potential could be slipping out of reach. It turned out that Marla had witnessed significant violence against her mother at home, making it impossible for her to focus in school.
Sonya
When five-year-old Sonya began kindergarten, she could not focus in the classroom and had difficulty forming relationships with adults and making friends with her peers. Complicating Sonya’s situation was the fact that her leg had been broken by her father when she was less than a year old. Even though she had been too young at the time to remember the incident, the fear of that experience—the betrayal of trust—still haunted Sonya and made it difficult for her to reach out to new people. It thwarted her ability to adjust to a classroom environment and achieve in school.
There is nothing new about the presence of traumatized children in our schools. Often without realizing it, teachers have been dealing with trauma’s impact for generations. What is new is that trauma researchers can now explain the hidden story behind many classroom difficulties plaguing our educational system. Recent psychological research has shown that childhood trauma from exposure to family violence can diminish concentration, memory, and the organizational and language abilities that children need to function well in school.18 For some children, this can lead to inappropriate behavior19 and learning problems in the classroom, the home, and the community.20 For other children, the manifestations of trauma include perfectionism, depression, anxiety, and self-destructive, or even suicidal, behavior.21 Studies show that abused children have more severe academic problems than comparison children. Specifically, they are more likely to receive special education services, have below-grade-

Executive Summar y 5

level achievement test scores, and have poor work habits; and they are 2.5 times more likely to fail a grade.22

The Adverse Childhood Experiences study found that adults exposed to adverse experiences in childhood, including those who had witnessed domestic violence or suffered abuse, were more likely to engage in risky activities such as drinking, smoking, and substance abuse.23 In the opinion of some experts, these are behavioral “coping devices”—attempts to reduce the emotional impact of adverse experiences.24 When teenagers engage in these risky behaviors, however, they often face disciplinary consequences at school, such as suspensions or expulsions.

Teachers can play an important role in connecting traumatized children to a safe and predictable school community and enabling them to become competent learners. To accomplish this goal, policy makers must provide schools with the tools they need to help all children learn.

Many experts, including members of the National Child Traumatic Stress Network (NCTSN), are calling for a community-wide effort to create contexts in which children traumatized by family violence can succeed.25 NCTSN asks schools to play a key role in this effort. School is a place where it is possible for traumatized children to forge strong relationships with caring adults and learn in a supportive, predictable, and safe environment. These are factors that can help protect children from, or at least ameliorate, some of the effects of exposure to family violence.26 In the broad-based effort this report recommends, schools will partner with parents and guardians—who may themselves be struggling with symptoms of trauma—and give teachers the support they need to teach children how to regulate or calm their emotions and behavior.

mastering both academic and social skills are key to

the healing process, the aim is to increase teaching and learning time and

reduce time spent on discipline. The ultimate goal is to help all traumatized

students become successful members of their school communities.27

Educators and policy makers—with the help of mental health professionals—can put the insights of research to work by implementing relatively cost-effective strategies. These strategies will help children traumatized by exposure to family violence learn and succeed in school.

This report is divided into three chapters, as follows:

Chapter 1

The Impact of Trauma on Learning
The first step in creating trauma-sensitive schools is to help educators become aware of trauma symptoms. Chapter 1 of this report describes the trauma response and the specific ways trauma can impact learning and behavior in the classroom. Teachers can use their existing expertise more effectively when they understand that many of the academic, social, and behavioral problems of traumatized children involve such difficulties as failing to understand directions, overreacting to comments from teachers and peers, misreading context, failing to connect cause and effect, and other forms of miscommunication. This report does not suggest that teachers become therapists. However, a better understanding of the difficulties traumatized children have in modulating their emotions and behaviors should lead schools to seek out therapeutic and positive behavioral supports, rather than responding with punitive measures such as suspensions and expulsions. A better understanding of how a positive community response can actually reduce the severity of the trauma

Executive Summar y 7
symptoms should encourage educators to infuse trauma-sensitive approaches for students and supports for personnel throughout their schools, because schools are the central community for most children.
Chapter 2
The Flexible Framework: An Action Plan for Schools
The Flexible Framework has been designed to help each school community develop a plan for integrating trauma-sensitive routines and individual supports throughout the school day.28 The Framework provides a structure that can be adapted to the unique needs of each school community, regardless of its organizational structure or educational philosophy. Each school will determine how to apply the Framework, which has six key elements:
I. Schoolwide Infrastructure and Culture;
II. Staff Training;
III. Linking with Mental Health Professionals;
IV. Academic Instruction for Traumatized Children;
V. Nonacademic Strategies; and
VI. School Policies, Procedures, and Protocols.
Rather than prescribing any one particular intervention, the Framework seeks to help schools establish environments that will enable children traumatized by exposure to family violence develop relationships with caring adults, learn to modulate their emotions and behaviors, and achieve at high educational levels. When schools have a better understanding of trauma, they can form effective linkages with mental health professionals who have an expertise in that field, make full use of available resources, and advocate for new resources and particular interventions that directly meet the needs of their students.

8 Helping Traumatized Children Learn
Chapter 3
Policy Recommendations
Schools and educators cannot do this work alone. Chapter 3 asks policy makers, legislators, and administrators to create laws and policies that support schools in addressing the trauma-related aspects of many behavioral and learning problems. Without supports within the school, teachers are almost forced to look the other way—the problems can seem so overwhelming.29 With supports, teachers can play an important role in connecting traumatized children to a safe and predictable school community and enable them to become competent learners.30 To accomplish this goal, policy makers must provide schools with the tools they need to help all children learn, including those who have been traumatized by exposure to family violence.
Chapter 3 sets forth the following public policy agenda:
1. T he Commonwealth should provide publicly funded schools and preschools with funds necessary to develop schoolwide action plans addressing the needs of traumatized children.
2. M assachusetts stakeholders should reach consensus on the laws, policies, and funding mechanisms necessary for schools to intervene early to address the needs of traumatized students and to decrease punitive responses.
3. T eachers and administrators should learn approaches and strategies for teaching children who may be traumatized.
4. Mental health professionals and other specialists providing services in school settings should respond appropriately to trauma-related learning and behavioral problems and should provide traumainformed consultations to educators.
5. The Department of Education should provide continuing information and support to schools.

Case 2:18-cv-00939-MJP Document 1-3 Filed 06/26/18 Page 62 of 393
Executive Summar y 9
6. R esearch should be funded on the extent to which learning and behavioral problems at school are related to untreated childhood trauma and on best schoolwide and individual practices for addressing the educational needs.
***
We are all too familiar with the extreme situation—children who try to overcome their feelings of vulnerability by inflicting violence on others.31 When child victims become victimizers, a society that failed to help these children when they needed it most faces the consequences of shortsighted policies. We can either invest in necessary supports for educators and services for children now, or we can allow the cycle of violence and failure to continue, dealing with children later through more costly institutions, including the criminal justice system.32
With the help of educators, traumatized children can flourish in their school communities and master the educational tasks of childhood, despite their overwhelmingly stressful experiences. This requires school environments that support staff, parents, and children, and that recognize and respond to the effects childhood trauma can have on children’s learning and behavior.33

Genesis of This Report
Staff at the Massachusetts Advocates for Children (MAC), a nonprofit children’s rights organization founded in 1969, regularly respond to requests from families desperately seeking help in obtaining school services to address learning problems or behaviors that have led to suspension and expulsion hearings. In 1998, MAC’s attorneys realized that many of these cases involved children who had been exposed to some form of family violence, either as witnesses to domestic violence or as the direct targets of abuse. Questioning whether there were better ways to deal with the behavioral and learning problems of these children, MAC brought together groups of parents, shelter workers, court personnel, and experts in trauma psychology, neuropsychology, education, social work, and law, in an attempt to understand the causes and nature of the challenges presented by children exposed to family violence.
These vibrant interdisciplinary discussions, along with input from focus groups held at two Boston public schools, highlighted the many learning and behavioral difficulties that can arise when children and teenagers come to school traumatized by exposure to family violence. MAC followed up by forming the Task Force on Children Affected by Domestic Violence (the Task Force), which produced a series of working papers calling for overarching policies that schools, courts, and housing and benefits programs could implement to address the needs of these children. The working paper on schools proposed funding to help educators create trauma-sensitive classroom environments.
The Massachusetts legislature responded to the issues articulated by the Task Force. In 2000, it passed legislation establishing a grant program through the Massachusetts Department of Education called “Creating a Safe and Supportive Learning Environment: Serving Youth Traumatized by Violence.” In 2004, the grant program was codified into law as “An Act for Alternative Education” (see MGL c. 69, sec. 1N, included in Appendix A). This new law, which is now part of the Massachusetts Education Reform Act, addresses the educational consequences of

trauma using a two-pronged approach: grants for alternative education programs and grants for safe and supportive school environments. In the first round of grants, six schools received pilot funding to create trauma-sensitive environments. Two of these schools used the Flexible Framework, devised by the Task Force, to increase their responsiveness to the needs of traumatized children. In the second round of grants (2004) the Framingham Public Schools adapted the framework for use across its district. This framework was refined through its use in schools, the work of the Task Force, and discussions held with many schools and community collaborators. (The Framework is set forth in chapter 2.)
In 2004, MAC expanded the work of the Task Force by joining in a partnership with the Hale and Dorr Legal Services Center of Harvard Law School to launch the Trauma and Learning Policy Initiative (TLPI). TLPI uses multiple advocacy strategies to carry out the Task Force’s vision, advocating for policies, laws, and practices that can help children traumatized by family violence succeed in school. TLPI attorneys, student advocates, psychological and educational consultants, and parent specialists provide individual case advocacy; reach out to educate parents, teens, educators, and other professionals; and build coalitions that enable the voices of the most vulnerable children and their parents to be heard in the policy arena. TLPI is also convening experts to develop forthcoming guidelines for making special education evaluations and school mental health consultations trauma sensitive.
Parents, teachers in regular and special education, principals, guidance counselors, social workers, language experts, advocates for battered women and children, staff in governmental agencies, and attorneys made significant contributions to this report, as have the psychologists, neuropsychologists, and trauma experts who reviewed it for accuracy and content.

The Trauma Response in the Classroom
Every day, children enter their classrooms bringing backpacks, pencils, paper—and their unique views of the world. Every child has his or her own expectations and insights, formed from experiences at home, in the community, and at school. When children witness violence between their adult caregivers or experience abuse or neglect, they can enter the classroom believing that the world is an unpredictable and threatening place.
A Worldview Gone Awry
Our fundamental assumptions about ourselves and about the world around us are the lens through which we view and evaluate events and relationships. They provide the conceptual framework that helps us make meaning of our experiences and enables us to function effectively.34
A nurturing home, in which children have stable attachments to adults and are treated with physical and emotional respect, generally instills a fundamentally affirmative self-image and view of the world as benevolent.35 Positive expectations tend to lead to the belief that others will appreciate our strengths, that people are essentially decent, and that there is a reason to be optimistic about the future. Children with secure attachments to adults and a positive worldview usually are able to regulate their emotions and develop the solid foundation necessary for adapting well at school.36
Conversely, violence at home can help create negative expectations and assumptions.37 Such children may have a diminished sense of selfworth and feel incapable of having a positive impact on the outside world.38 Hopelessness, self-blame, and lack of control are typical of the feelings that can result from trauma; these feelings may lead to overwhelming despair and a loss of the ability to imagine the future or hope that circumstances will change. Children in this condition can be ill-prepared for the academic and social challenges of the classroom.

In Jenny Horsman’s book Too Scared To Learn, an adult survivor of childhood sexual abuse describes how her negative worldview affected her at school:
I remember crying in the night. I found it difficult to hear Mrs. Patterson when she spoke in the classroom. I felt as if she were speaking from beneath tumbling water, or from the end of a long tunnel. She assumed I was daydreaming. I stopped imagining that I might one day be a teacher. . . . No longer did my imagination dance me through the leaves. The sound of ringing church bells irritated me. Mostly I felt ashamed, different.39
Children look to their parents for stability and protection. When a parent is the source of violence, the child’s sense of security and safety can be compromised or destroyed,40 replaced instead by fear and anxiety. Lacking a sense of security, a child can have difficulty exploring the world through play, developing self-confidence, and maintaining motivation.41 A parent’s unpredictable or violent behavior can lead to difficulty forming personal attachments and may foster relationships that are based on fear and insecurity.42
Many children exposed to violence view the world as a threatening place, in which danger and pain are to be expected. They see the world not through rose-colored glasses, but through a lens tinted somber gray.43 Psychiatrist and trauma expert Judith Herman explains:
Adaptation to this climate of constant danger requires a state of constant alertness. Children in an abusive environment develop extraordinary abilities to scan for warning signs of attack. They become minutely attuned to their abusers’ inner states. They learn to recognize subtle changes in facial expression, voice, and body language as signals of anger, sexual arousal, intoxication, or dissociation. This nonverbal communication becomes highly automatic and occurs for the most part outside of conscious awareness. Child victims learn to respond without being able to name or identify the danger signals that evoked their alarm.44

Traumatized children may anticipate that the school
environment will be threatening and constantly scrutinize it for any signs of danger. Their mission is to avoid this perceived
danger and pain.

Children traumatized by family violence rarely understand that they see the world in a different way than their nontraumatized peers and teachers do.45 Traumatized children cannot simply remove their “trauma glasses” as they go between home and school, from dangerous place to safe place. They may anticipate that the school environment will be threatening and constantly scrutinize it for any signs of danger. Their mission is to avoid this perceived danger and pain.46 Sadly, this mission often sabotages their ability to hear and understand a teacher’s positive messages, to perform well academically, and to behave appropriately.

Fear as a Way of Life: The Developing Brain

The great risk for children who live in violent homes and who routinely operate in survival mode is that this way of functioning can permeate every aspect of their lives and can even take on a life of its own. According to brain researchers, when children encounter a perceived threat to their safety, their brains trigger a complex set of chemical and neurological events known as the “stress response.”47 The stress response activates a natural instinct to prepare to fight, freeze, or flee from the unsafe event. Under normal circumstances these responses to stress are constructive and help keep a child safe.

However, when a child operates in overwhelming states of stress or fear, survival responses that may be fully appropriate in danger-laden situations (e.g., shutting down, constantly surveying the room for danger, expecting to fight or run away at a moment’s notice) can become a regular mode of functioning. Even when the dangers are not present, children may react to the world as if they are.48 Unable to regulate heightened levels of arousal and emotional responses, they simply cannot turn off the survival strategies that their brains have been conditioned to employ.49

Neurobiologist Bruce Perry and his colleagues at the Child Trauma Academy explain that the most developed areas of a child’s brain are the ones used most frequently. When children live in a persistent state of

Case 2:18-cv-00939-MJP Document 1-3 Filed 06/26/18 Page 71 of 393
18 H e lp i ng Tra u m a t i zed C h i l d r en Lea r n
fear, the areas of their brains controlling the fear response can become overdeveloped.50 These parts of the brain may direct behavior even in situations in which it would be more appropriate for other parts of the brain to be in charge. It is important to note that the areas of the brain active in fearful states are different from those active in calm states, and it is predominately the areas active in calm states that are required for academic learning.51
Brain researchers use the term “plasticity” to explain the environment’s enormous influence on the growing child’s developing brain.52 This means that children’s brains are more malleable than those of adults. However, just as traumatic experiences can undermine the brain’s development, good experiences can enhance it.53 In addition, skill development is a scaffolding process, with each skill building upon the one before. Both the plasticity of brain development and the scaffolding nature of skill development are strong reasons to intervene as early as possible with supportive, ameliorative, and protective experiences. Early intervention gives a child the best chance to follow a developmental trajectory unencumbered by the effects of trauma.54
Trauma: Reactions to Stressful Events
Experts explain that trauma is not an event itself, but rather a response to a stressful experience in which a person’s ability to cope is dramatically undermined. Lenore Terr defines childhood trauma as the impact of external forces that “[render] the young person temporarily helpless and [break] past ordinary coping and defensive operation. . . . [This includes] not only those conditions marked by intense surprise but also those marked by prolonged and sickening anticipation.”55 Similarly, Judith Herman writes that traumatic events “overwhelm the ordinary human adaptations to life. . . . They confront human beings with the extremities of helplessness and terror.”56 The range of potentially traumatic events in childhood is quite broad, including not only physical threat and harm but also emotional maltreatment, neglect, abandonment, and devastating loss.
Every traumatic experience is different, and each child’s response depends on his or her coping skills and resources and on the context

Case 2:18-cv-00939-MJP Document 1-3 Filed 06/26/18 Page 72 of 393
The I mpa c t o f Tra uma o n L e a r ning 19
and circumstances in which the stressful event occurs. Whether a child develops a trauma reaction that increases in severity, becomes chronic, and is less responsive to intervention or has a reaction that is moderate, manageable, and time limited depends on several factors. These include the nature of the experience, the characteristics of the child, and the way the family, school, and community respond (see Appendix C). For example, chronic or repetitive traumatic experiences, especially those perpetrated intentionally by a caregiver, are likely to result in a different set of symptoms than a single shocking traumatic event.57
The age at which a child The age at which a child experiences events resulting in experiences traumatic trauma is another important factor in determining its
events is another factor in severity. For example, an older child may have the verbal determining its severity. skills to articulate the experience and gain perspective on it more quickly than a very young child, whose lack of language development and perspective limits the extent to which the event can be understood and processed. On the other hand, an older child could be devastated by betrayal in a way that could go unnoticed by a younger child. Brain researchers also explain that growing children go through “critical periods,” during which certain areas of the brain develop very rapidly and are more susceptible than usual to stressful experiences.58
So many factors influence individual reactions to stressful events that even children in the same family who share similar traumatic backgrounds can have different responses. One child in a family might develop an intense drive for academic achievement. Another may engage in behavior that makes concentration nearly impossible for that child and the other students in the class. A third may appear to be unaffected, yet suffer in very quiet ways.
It is critical for educators to understand that a person’s social context can have a tremendous impact on the severity of the trauma symptoms. Trauma expert Mary Harvey explains that a trauma response is influenced not only by an individual’s particular strengths and the nature of the event, but also by the level of support a person receives from the surrounding community.59 When the community responds in helpful ways, there is what Harvey calls an “ecological fit” between the person and the community:

Case 2:18-cv-00939-MJP Document 1-3 Filed 06/26/18 Page 73 of 393
20 H e lp i ng Tra u m a t i zed C h i l d r en Lea r n
The construct of “[ecological] fit” refers to the quality and helpfulness of the relationship existing between the individual and his or her social context. Interventions that achieve ecological fit are those that enhance the environmentperson relationship—i.e., that reduce isolation, foster social competence, support positive coping, and promote belongingness in relevant social contexts.60 Schools are children’s communities. An ecological fit for a child at school would include a welcoming environment where the staff understands trauma’s impact on relationships, behavior, and learning. In this environment, schoolwide trauma-sensitive approaches would be woven throughout the school day, and individual supports, related to skill and social development, would be trauma-sensitive. The links between exposure to family violence and children’s behavior are often hidden or unclear, but a trauma-sensitive environment can provide tools for recognizing when more supports are needed. The Flexible Framework in chapter 2 sets forth a structure for establishing such a trauma-sensitive ecology or context.
So many factors influence individual reactions to overwhelming stress that even children in the same family who share similar traumatic backgrounds can have different responses.

Trauma’s Impact on Academic Performance, Behavior, and Relationships
Many of the obstacles traumatized children face in the classroom result from their inability to process information, meaningfully distinguish between threatening and nonthreatening situations, form trusting relationships with adults, and modulate their emotions.
For some children, the combination and extent of their reactions to trauma warrant a formal diagnosis. Post-traumatic stress disorder (PTSD) is the diagnosis given to a particular set of trauma-related symptoms. (See Appendix B for an explanation of PTSD.) As PTSD does not capture the full range of symptoms often seen in traumatized children, students can come with a range of diagnoses that may be comorbid with trauma. These include depression, attention-deficit hyperactivity disorder, oppositional defiant disorder, conduct disorder, anxiety disorder, phobic disorder, and borderline personality.61 Because the clinical manifestations of trauma are exceedingly broad and not captured well by traditional diagnoses, Bessel van der Kolk has proposed a new diagnosis for children with histories of complex trauma called “developmental trauma disorder” that attempts to account for the emotional, behavioral, neurobiological, and developmental consequences of trauma.62
For many children, however, their reactions to traumatic events manifest themselves in a range of problems that do not meet the standards for a diagnosis. The children may never be identified as having trauma symptoms or may have what appear to be trauma symptoms with no indication that a traumatic event precipitated it. We caution that all children with trauma-like symptoms should not be presumed to have trauma histories. It is important to explore all possible reasons for a child’s difficulty at school.
In the sections that follow, we organize the research according to the ways trauma can impact learning, behavior, and relationships at school, to broaden understanding and not to respond to a specific diagnosis. The

principles in the Framework in chapter 2 are designed to infuse traumasensitive supports throughout the school; their use is not contingent on whether traumatic events have been identified or a diagnosis reached.
More research is needed on the extent to which trauma plays a role in problems children experience at school, on ways to identify when these problems might be trauma related, and on strategies to address the needs specific to various forms of exposure to violence. The research to date, however, provides considerable insight into children’s behavior and learning and the challenges educators face in their classrooms.
Childhood Trauma and Academic Performance
Learning to read, write, take part in a discussion, and solve mathematical problems requires attention, organization, comprehension, memory, the ability to produce work, engagement in learning, and trust.63 Another prerequisite for achieving classroom competency is the ability to selfregulate attention, emotions, and behavior.64
Not surprisingly, traumatic experiences have the power to undermine the development of linguistic and communicative skills, thwart the establishment of a coherent sense of self, and compromise the ability to attend to classroom tasks and instructions, organize and remember new information, and grasp cause-and-effect relationships—all of which are necessary to process information effectively.65 Trauma can interfere with the capacity for creative play, which is one of the ways children learn how to cope with the problems of everyday life; 66 and it can adversely affect the ability to have good peer and adult relationships.67
n Language and Communication Skills Traumatic experiences can disrupt the ability of children to learn and process verbal information and use language as a vehicle for communication. These language problems can undermine literacy skills, social-emotional development, and behavioral self-regulation.
1. Learning and retrieving new verbal information Researchers Streeck-Fischer and van der Kolk explain that traumatized children “are easily overstimulated and cannot achieve

the state of secure readiness that is necessary in order to be open to new information.”68 When traumatized children enter the classroom in a hyperaroused state, they may be unable to attend to or process academically significant information and may have great difficulty expressing themselves verbally. (See Appendix B for a discussion of hyperarousal in traumatized children.) These findings have serious implications for the ability of traumatized children to function well within the school setting. As Perry explains, traumatized and nontraumatized children often have very different cognitive experiences in the classroom:
The calm child may sit in the same classroom next to the child in an alarm state, both hearing the same lecture by the teacher. Even if they have identical IQs, the child that is calm can focus on the words of the teacher and, using the neocortex, engage in abstract cognition. The child in an
Trauma can disrupt the ability of children to learn and process verbal information and use language as a vehicle for communication.

24 H e lp i ng Tra u m a t i zed C h i l d r en Lea r n
alarm state will be less efficient at processing and storing the verbal information the teacher is providing.69
One traumatized teenager gives a poignant description of how processing problems in the classroom affected her learning:
I could see the math teacher’s mouth moving in the classroom but couldn’t hear a thing. It was as if I were in a soundless chamber. She was smiling and clearly talking, I just couldn’t process a word of it. I had been an excellent math student, but the day she told me I was “spacey” and unfocused was the day I stopped connecting to math. My grades dropped and they took me out of the advanced classes.70
Studies are beginning to uncover neurobiological evidence that the ability to connect words to experience can be impeded by trauma. One 1996 study scanned the brains of people diagnosed with post-traumatic stress disorder. After baseline scans were taken, researchers induced fear in the subjects by reminding them of their traumatic experiences. The scans revealed that the areas of the brain involving anxiety and other intense emotions (limbic and paralimbic systems) activated when the subjects’ traumatic experiences were invoked. When the limbic system activated, the area of the brain associated with language (Broca’s area) became less active.71
It may be obvious to a child in a state of anxiety that something inside his or her head has shifted to inhibit language and thought processing. However, this shift may not be apparent to a teacher until the child is called upon to speak or demonstrate that he or she has understood and analyzed information that has been presented.
2. S ocial and emotional communication Traumatized children may have a relationship to language that is different from that of their nontraumatized peers. Research suggests that communicative development is influenced by the interactive styles and social context in which early language is established.72 This can affect mastery of basic literacy skills, the ability to use verbal skills, and how and why the child communicates. Coster and Cicchetti explain

Case 2:18-cv-00939-MJP Document 1-3 Filed 06/26/18 Page 78 of 393
The I mpa c t o f Tra uma o n L e a r ning 25
that when a caregiver’s primary interactions with a child are focused on controlling the child’s behavior rather than on responding to thoughts and feelings, the child may acquire a predominantly instrumental understanding of language. For such a child, language becomes a tool that “serve[s] to get tasks accomplished,” rather than a “medium for social or affective exchanges.”73
When this pattern of using language primarily as a tool, rather than as a means to express feelings, persists throughout the preschool years, the child may have difficulty “use[ing] language to articulate needs and feelings, which has been suggested as an important step toward development of appropriate cognitive and behavioral controls.”74 According to Coster and Cicchetti, using language in a predominantly instrumental way leads to difficulty with “the ability to convey abstractions, which has been suggested as a critical transition in the acquisition of literacy skills.”75 It can also hamper “the ability to sustain coherent narrative and dialogue, which is a key competence for social exchange with both peer and adult figures.”76

3. Problem solving and analysis Coster and Cicchetti explain that traumatized children may have had “minimal experience using verbal problem-solving methods and little exposure to adults who encourage the kind of self-reporting of ideas or feelings often expected in a classroom setting. [Children] may also have had limited experience attending to complex communications

and may have difficulty extracting key ideas embedded in more lengthy narratives.”78 This is consistent with the findings of Allen and Oliver, who found a significant correlation between child neglect and deficits in both receptive and expressive language. They hypothesize that neglected children are not adequately exposed to the types of stimulation that are critical for normative language development. 79
Coster and Cicchetti argue that a thorough language evaluation should be part of the educational assessment of children exposed to family violence. Emphasizing that impaired language development may affect the ability to use words to problem solve, these researchers make the powerful point that the language evaluation should include not only linguistic aspects of language but also pragmatic and narrative functions.80
n Organizing Narrative Material A child’s successful completion of many academic tasks depends on the ability to “bring a linear order to the chaos of daily experience.”81 Traumatic experiences can inhibit this ability to organize material sequentially, leading to difficulty reading, writing, and communicating verbally.82
The first step in the development of the ability to organize material sequentially is the establishment of sequential memory. In the earliest years of a child’s life, memories and information are encoded episodically, as a collection of random events rather than as a coherent narrative. The transition to sequential semantic memory “is most easily made in environments marked by consistent, predictable routines and familiar, reliable caregivers.”83 Many children enduring traumatic stress are deprived of such a stable environment. Instead, they may be “raised in households in which rules and routines are subject to the whim of the parent”; for them, the move into a more sequential ordering of the world may be considerably more difficult than it is for other children.84
If the development of sequential memory is delayed and the ability to learn new information sequentially is impaired, traumatized children will have difficulty organizing and processing the content of academic lessons for later retrieval and application. This helps explain why traumatized children who have trouble with sequential organization

Case 2:18-cv-00939-MJP Document 1-3 Filed 06/26/18 Page 80 of 393
The I mpa c t o f Tra uma o n L e a r ning 27
respond well to classrooms in which there are orderly transitions and clear rules and that offer them assistance with organizing their tasks.
n Cause-and-Effect Relationships When cognitive development occurs in an inconsistent and unpredictable environment, children may have trouble comprehending cause-andeffect relationships and recognizing their own ability to affect what happens in the world.85 According to Craig, “Most children grasp this process during the sensorimotor period, through an active exploration of the world around them,” in which they learn “they can make things happen.”86 In contrast, children living with violence may suffer from “physical restriction and unrealistic parental expectations that inhibit their exploration of the world and their emergent sense of competence.”87 When no logical cause-and-effect relationships govern their experiences at home, these children have difficulty internalizing a sense that they can influence what happens to them. Craig explains how a compromised understanding of cause-and-effect can undermine a child’s motivation and behavior in the classroom:
An extended experience of perceived low impact on the world inhibits the development of such behaviors as goal setting and delayed gratification. These skills, so important to school success, rely on a person’s ability to predict and make inferences. Similarly, failure to establish an internalized locus of control can result in lack of both motivation and persistence in academic tasks, as well as a resistance to behavior-management techniques that assume an understanding of cause and effect.88
Children living in circumstances that do not allow them to make connections between their actions and the responses they trigger can be left wary of the future, which feels to them both unpredictable and out of their control. This may cause some children to become extremely passive.89 A child whose inability to grasp cause-and-effect relationships is extreme may not even master the early developmental task of achieving “object constancy”—the understanding that an object or person still exists when it is hidden from sight.90 Van der Kolk explains that failure to achieve object constancy is common among traumatized children who lack a sense of predictability in their environment.91

28 H e lp i ng Tra u m a t i zed C h i l d r en Lea r n
n Taking Another’s Perspective Many traumatized children have problems with academic and social tasks that require them to take the perspective of another person. When a child learns not to express a preference before assessing the mood of the parent, he or she cannot fully develop a sense of self. In particular, this can result in an “inability to define the boundaries of the self,” which can lead to difficulty making independent choices, articulating preferences, and gaining perspective.92 In addition, if stress from family violence interferes with normal playtime and with explorative play activity, the ability to “take the role of the other or to appreciate another person’s point of view may be seriously impaired.”93
Difficulty understanding the perspective of others has serious ramifications. Deficits in this area can make it hard to solve a problem from a different point of view, infer ideas from text, participate in social conversation, and develop empathy in relationships.
n Attentiveness to Classroom Tasks Traumatized children can be distracted or lack focus in the classroom because anxiety and fears for their own and others’ safety chronically occupy their thoughts. Streeck-Fischer and van der Kolk explain that these attentional disorders have several causes:
[The children] do not pay attention because they are unable to distinguish between relevant and irrelevant information. They tend to misinterpret innocuous stimuli as traumatic, and if not interpreted as traumatic, they tend to ignore sensory input. Easily threatened by the unexpected, traumatised children are prone to become excessively physiologically aroused when faced with novel information.94
A child who is inattentive to the classroom task at hand may actually be focused on “interpreting the teacher’s mood.”95 Another child might disassociate from the immediate environment and not process information presented by the teacher at all.
Children who pay attention to the wrong things and children who disassociate can find it difficult to keep up with classroom tasks. Lost and

Case 2:18-cv-00939-MJP Document 1-3 Filed 06/26/18 Page 82 of 393

unable to reconnect with the academic activities, their anxiety can increase, and difficulties with regulating emotion may come into play. Some of them may then engage in disruptive behavior as they try to catch up. Many traumatized children who exhibit the symptoms of anxiety, hypervigilance to danger, and language-processing problems are diagnosed as having attention-deficit hyperactivity disorder (ADHD). Research shows that ADHD and trauma often coexist, but because both disorders have similar symptoms, trauma may be overlooked when a diagnosis of ADHD is made.96 If a child is suffering from both ADHD and trauma, appropriate treatment can be provided that responds to both sets of problems.97 Thus, it is important to assess whether a single diagnosis is masking the need to evaluate for trauma. n Regulating Emotions According to Masten and Coatsworth, the ability to self-regulate or modulate emotions is a key predictor of academic and social success.98
Providing opportunities to succeed must be reinforced by a classroom environment that supports the student’s success.

Case 2:18-cv-00939-MJP Document 1-3 Filed 06/26/18 Page 83 of 393

Shields and Cicchetti explain that deficits in the capacity to regulate emotion are a cause for serious concern because “the ability to modulate behavior, attention, and emotion underlie children’s adaptive functioning in a number of key domains, including self-development, academic achievement, and interpersonal relationships.”99 StreeckFischer and van der Kolk emphasize that such deficits are widespread among children exposed to family violence: “Lack of capacity for emotional self-regulation so critical to school functioning is probably the most striking feature of these chronically traumatised children.”100
Difficulty regulating emotions can lead to a host of problems in and out of school. These potential difficulties include poor impulse control, aggression against the self and/or others, trouble interpreting emotional signals, chronic uncertainty about the reliability of other people, and lack of a predictable sense of self.101 Shields and Cicchetti suggest that hypervigilance may play a key role in undermining the development of emotional self-regulation. They postulate that, unlike the nontraumatized child, the hypervigilant child cannot shift away from distressing cues in the service of maintaining emotional regulation.102
Traumatized children often experience fear, anxiety, irritability, helplessness, anger, shame, depression, and guilt, but their ability to identify and express these feelings is often underdeveloped and poorly regulated. Some of these children may express emotions without restraint and seem impulsive, undercontrolled, unable to reflect, edgy, oversensitive, or aggressive. They may overreact to perceived provocation in the classroom and on the playground. Other traumatized children block out painful or uncomfortable emotions; they may appear disinterested, disconnected, or aloof. For them, the consequence of not knowing how to communicate or interpret emotions is the dampening or constricting of their feelings. Another group of traumatized children protect themselves from unmanageable stress and anxiety by dissociating—that is, by completely disconnecting emotions from the events with which they are associated.
Difficulty knowing how they feel and expressing feelings in words can put traumatized children at risk for somatic symptoms,103 including

Case 2:18-cv-00939-MJP Document 1-3 Filed 06/26/18 Page 84 of 393
The I mpa c t o f Tra uma o n L e a r ning 31
headaches, gastrointestinal complaints, body pains, and general malaise. Fatigue, sleeplessness, eating disorders, body-image concerns, and health problems later in life are also associated with trauma.
n Executive Functions The so-called “executive functions”—goal setting, anticipating consequences, and initiating and carrying out plans—are very important for achieving academic and social success and for establishing vocational goals.104 A traumatized child can develop a bleak perspective, expectations of failure, a low sense of selfworth, and a foreshortened view of the future, all of which disrupt this ability to plan, anticipate, and hope.105 Van der Kolk explains that because traumatized children often have distorted inner representations of the world, they have no “internal maps to guide them” and that, consequently, they “act instead of plan.”106
This is consistent with what researchers know about the effects of trauma on the developing child’s brain. The prefrontal cortex, the area of the brain primarily responsible for the development of the executive functions, has been shown to be adversely affected by trauma.107 One study found significant deficits in executive function and abstract reasoning among maltreated children with post-traumatic stress disorder, as compared to sociodemographically matched children with no history of maltreatment.108 In another study, boys with severe abuse histories had particular difficulty with executive-function tasks that required them to refrain from taking actions that would lead to adverse consequences.109 Children with severe executive-function deficits may benefit from small, structured classrooms where they can be carefully taught to understand the consequences of their actions.
n Engaging in the Curriculum Traumatic experiences can deplete motivation and internal resources for academic engagement. Studying the effect of maltreatment on children’s academic and behavioral adjustment, Shonk and Cicchetti found that academic engagement is a powerful predictor of academic success.110 They define optimal academic engagement as “self-initiated, regulated, and persistent mastery for the sake of competence, a preference for optimally challenging tasks, and self-directed behaviors such as paying

attention and completing assignments.”111 However, as they go on to point out, because of a focus on security, “many traumatized toddlers, preschoolers, and school-age children display excessive dependency, social wariness, reduced exploration, deficits in affect regulation, and impaired autonomous mastery.”112

Not all traumatized children suffer from the academic challenges listed above. As discussed earlier, many factors impact how severe a traumatic response will be. Overall, however, many traumatized children struggle with considerable difficulties that impede progress in school. Often, these difficulties also interfere with their ability to behave appropriately in the school setting.
Childhood Trauma and Classroom Behavior

The school setting can be a battleground in which traumatized children’s assumptions of the world as a dangerous place sabotage their ability to develop constructive relationships with nurturing adults. Unfortunately, many traumatized children adopt behavioral
coping mechanisms that can frustrate educators and evoke exasperated reprisals, reactions that both strengthen expectations of confrontation and danger and reinforce a negative self-image.

Traumatized children’s behavior can be perplexing. Prompted by internal states not fully understood by the children themselves and unobservable by teachers, traumatized children can be ambivalent, unpredictable, and demanding.

traumatized children’s most challenging behavior often originates in immense feelings of vulnerability.
Researchers explain that when we believe an individual has complete control over his or her behavior, we are more likely to be angry when that behavior is inappropriate. But if we recognize the factors that shape a child’s behavior and compromise self-control, we are more likely to attempt to ease the child’s plight.113 Because traumatized children may be used to chaotic, unpredictable caregivers, they often try hard to appear in control even though they may be feeling out of control. As a result, they are more likely to be disapproved of and condemned by busy, overburdened educators, even though they are among the students most in need of nurturance.
In his book On Playing a Poor Hand Well, Mark Katz describes how an adult’s view of a child’s problematic behavior might change if the reasons for that behavior were known:
Not realizing that children exposed to inescapable, overwhelming stress may act out their pain, that they may misbehave, not listen to us, or seek our attention in all the wrong ways, can lead us to punish these children for their misbehavior. The behavior is so willful, so intentional. She controlled herself yesterday, she can control herself today. If we only knew what happened last night, or this morning before she got to school, we would be shielding the same child we’re now reprimanding.114
To avoid reminders of trauma or the emotions associated with it, children may consciously or unconsciously adopt strategies such as social withdrawal, aggressiveness, or substance abuse. Aggressive or controlling behavior can be a way of coping with internal turmoil and a sense of powerlessness and vulnerability; it may also arise from hypersensitivity to danger or from identification with the aggressor at home.115 Other traumatized children may try to cope with their fears by checking door locks, constantly expressing concerns about younger siblings, and so on. All these behaviors may be responses to feelings they cannot identify or describe.

Many of the effects of trauma on classroom behavior originate from the same problems that create academic difficulties: the inability to process social cues and to convey feelings in an appropriate manner. For this reason, traumatized children’s behavior in the classroom can be highly confusing, and children suffering from the behavioral symptoms of trauma are frequently profoundly misunderstood. Whether a traumatized child externalizes (acts out) or internalizes (withdraws, is numb, frozen, or depressed), the effects of trauma can lead to strained relationships with teachers and peers.
n Reactivity and Impulsivity Chronic trauma can impair the development of children’s ability to regulate their emotions and to control impulsive behaviors.116 Reactions can be triggered in hypervigilant children if they feel they are being provoked or if something reminds them of the trauma. An incident or remark that might seem minor to a nontraumatized child may be perceived as threatening by a traumatized child, who then responds in a seemingly disproportionate way. It is helpful for teachers to know what triggers might cause a traumatized child to become hyperaroused or to reexperience a traumatic event in the classroom. Behaviorists may be able, through careful observation, to identify some of the child’s triggers. Often, however, the help of a mental health expert is needed to be sure of what may be triggering a particular child.
n Aggression Hypervigilant children who are prone to reactivity and impulsiveness may become verbally and/or physically aggressive toward teachers and peers. The aggression may spring from misinterpretation of comments and actions due to the child’s inability to adopt another’s perspective, underdeveloped linguistic skills, and/or inexperience with verbal problem solving. Studies have shown that traumatized children often have “distorted perceptions of the intentions, feelings, and behaviors of others as well as . . . hostile/aggressive social behavior.”117 One study also found that traumatized children “were less attentive to relevant social cues, made more misattributions of others’ negative or hostile intent, and were less likely to generate competent solutions to interpersonal problems.”118

Case 2:18-cv-00939-MJP Document 1-3 Filed 06/26/18 Page 88 of 393
The I mpa c t o f Tra uma o n L e a r ning 35
Carlson reported that in some cases this aggressive behavior occurs “in lieu of the child’s expression of his [or her] trauma-related fears.”119 In this sense, aggressive behavior is less akin to the willful defiance of an obstinate student than the response of a frightened child to his or her experience of traumatic violence. Carlson also explains that “aggression towards others might occur because a person with a general expectancy of danger might take a ‘strike first’ position to ward off harm.”120 Shields and Cicchetti point out that “angry reactivity would be a likely response among individuals who fear victimization and exploitation. … Because maltreated children tend to perceive threat in even neutral or friendly situations, they may evidence a self-defensive reactivity that is consistent with their experiences and expectations but inappropriate to the context at hand.”121 Thus they explain that hypervigilant attention processes combine with “maladaptive social information processing to foster emotional negativity and reactivity among maltreated children; this emotion dysregulation, in turn, seems to provoke reactive aggression.”122
Because these behaviors can be based on fear, reactivity, misinterpretation of social information, and hypervigilience, most traumatized children do best in a calm environment that accepts no bullying or teasing and in which firm limits are set on negative behavior.
n Defiance Children who enter the classroom in a state of low-level fear may refuse to respond to teachers either by trying to take control of their situation through actively defiant behavior or, more passively and perhaps less consciously, by “freezing.” Either way, the child is not receptive or responsive to the teacher or the demands of the classroom. Children who actively try to take control may be more overt and deliberate in their unwillingness to cooperate. This can be particularly frustrating to teachers, since these children can appear to be in control of their behavior. Teachers often attempt to gain the compliance of “frozen” children via directives, but this approach tends to escalate the anxiety and solidify the inability to comply, as Perry describes:
At this point, they tend to feel somewhat out of control and will cognitively (and often, physically) freeze. When adults around them ask them to comply with some directive, they may act as

Case 2:18-cv-00939-MJP Document 1-3 Filed 06/26/18 Page 89 of 393
36 H e lp i ng Tra u m a t i zed C h i l d r en Lea r n
if they haven’t heard or they “refuse.” This forces the adult—a teacher, a parent, a counselor—to give the child another set of directives. Typically, these directives involve more threat. The adult will say, “If you don’t do this, I will . . .” The nonverbal and verbal character of this “threat” makes the child feel more anxious, threatened, and out of control. The more anxious the child feels, the quicker the child will move from anxious to threatened, and from threatened to terrorized.123
n Withdrawal Children who withdraw in the classroom cannot participate effectively. Unsurprisingly, these children rarely attract their teachers’ attention. Many demands are placed on teachers, not the least of which is managing children who disruptively act out their suffering. Richard Weissbourd, in his book The Vulnerable Child, describes the experience of a first-grade teacher whose classroom included several children traumatized by sexual abuse, community violence, and neglect:
Mary Martinez is aware that many of her children are suffering from one or another of these quiet hardships, yet putting out the brushfires can take all her attention. Neglect does not get special attention from her until it becomes severe. Whereas [some children] may secure attention because they are provocative or display directly or symbolically how they have been hurt or abused, . . . the counselor at Martinez’s school worries especially about neglected and abused children who, instead of acting out, come to school dead to the world, withdrawn. . . . “Withdrawn kids get zero here. You have to be extraordinarily withdrawn to be referred to me.”124
Feelings of vulnerability may foster reluctance to engage in the classroom. As Pynoos, Steinberg, and Goenjian state, “Preschool tasks of cooperation and sharing in relationship to other children may be interfered with by withdrawal, emotional constriction, and disrupted impulse control.”125 Some traumatized children disconnect themselves from the present by dissociating, or “going away” in their minds; they

Case 2:18-cv-00939-MJP Document 1-3 Filed 06/26/18 Page 90 of 393
The I mpa c t o f Tra uma o n L e a r ning 37
may not be aware that they have “left” the classroom and missed large amounts of information. Dissociation may be hard for a teacher to recognize unless it is extreme.
One student explains:
I couldn’t stand to be in the school. Often I felt like I couldn’t breathe. I would stare out the window and let my mind go all over the place. Sometimes whole weeks would go by and I would not even be aware that time had passed. Next thing I would know I was being told I was yet again failing a course.126
Withdrawn behavior can be a symptom of depression, anxiety, fear of negotiating interpersonal relationships, or difficulties arising from compromised self-confidence.
n Perfectionism Children exposed to violence at home are often subject to the arbitrary will of caregivers who have unrealistic expectations for childhood behavior. Afraid to disappoint these caregivers and incur their explosive response, children often try, and inevitably fail, to meet these expectations. In their genuine desire for approval and success, these children may become perfectionists.127
Some perfectionists secretly long to excel but become easily frustrated and give up when they encounter difficulty mastering a task, often preferring to be viewed by teachers and fellow students as noncompliant rather than as unable. To the teacher, it may appear that such a child is simply refusing to try.128
Other perfectionists engage in an uncompromising struggle for academic success, but are never satisfied with their achievements. In an attempt to make sense of their experiences, acutely traumatized children may assume responsibility for their caregivers’ crimes and deeply internalize a sense of badness. Paradoxically, this intensely negative feeling can lead to zealously perfectionist behavior that masks a grave emotional problem. According to Herman,

Case 2:18-cv-00939-MJP Document 1-3 Filed 06/26/18 Page 91 of 393
38 H e lp i ng Tra u m a t i zed C h i l d r en Lea r n
In the effort to placate her abusers, the child victim often becomes a superb performer. She attempts to do whatever is required of her. She may become . . . an academic achiever, a model of social conformity. She brings to all these tasks a perfectionist zeal, driven by the desperate need to find favor in her parents’ eyes.129
Some perfectionist children may engage in coping behaviors that cement the distance between themselves and others in order to avoid the stress resulting from their inability to perform academic and social tasks. As Craig explains, “Children may develop avoidance patterns of oppositional behavior and incomplete work as ‘face-saving’ techniques for getting out of play time. Though painful in themselves, these practices may seem safer to the child than the experience of failure before peers.”130
Perfectionist children who are easily frustrated can become despondent when they encounter difficulties. Distress tends to plague even those who do succeed in achieving excellent grades and displaying exemplary conduct while in the midst of extreme adversity. These children sometimes pay a big price by living with high levels of long-term distress.131
Childhood Trauma and Relationships
Perhaps one of the most important roles schools can play in the lives of traumatized children is helping them to have good relationships with both peers and adults. Positive role models and ways of dealing with peers can play a major role in the healing process and lead to strong academic, social, and behavioral outcomes.
n Relationships with School Personnel Children’s struggle with traumatic stress and their insecure relationships with adults outside of school can adversely affect their relationships with school personnel. Preoccupied with their physical and psychological safety and lacking appropriate models, traumatized children may be distrustful of adults or unsure of the security of the school setting in general. To gain a sense of control,

Case 2:18-cv-00939-MJP Document 1-3 Filed 06/26/18 Page 92 of 393
The I mpa c t o f Tra uma o n L e a r ning 39

they may challenge school personnel, or they may overact because they misinterpret classroom encounters.132 In either case, children may behave confrontationally, even aggressively, in their relationships with school personnel. Craig explains that “these children often vie for power with classroom teachers, since they know that they are safe only when they control the environment. They do not like surprises or spontaneous events, which are perceived as dangerous or out of their control.”133 For this reason, many traumatized children have particular difficulty with transitions during the school day.

Researchers point out that it is important for traumatized children to form meaningful relationships with caring adults. Accomplishing this goal requires a schoolwide infrastructure that allows time for positive relationships to develop between students and both academic and nonacademic school personnel.

n Relationships with Peers

Traumatized children may suffer delays in the development of age-

appropriate social skills. They may not know how to initiate and cultivate

healthy interpersonal relationships. Their “post-traumatic symptoms

or behavior . . . may acutely disturb a developing close relationship

with a best friend, create a sense of isolation from peers, or lead to

social ostracism.”134

Traumatized children

who are reactive,

impulsive, or aggressive

may mask their feelings

of vulnerability with a

“strike-first” posture in

response to threat. Seeing

through the lens of their

negative worldview,

they often misinterpret

classroom encounters

and then overreact with confrontation and aggression that frightens their peers.

Perhaps one of the most important roles schools can play in the lives of traumatized children is helping them to have good relationships with both peers and adults.

Case 2:18-cv-00939-MJP Document 1-3 Filed 06/26/18 Page 93 of 393
40 H e lp i ng Tra u m a t i zed C h i l d r en Lea r n
Because traumatized children are often “unable to appreciate clearly who they or others are, they have problems enlisting other people as allies on their behalf. Other people are sources of terror or pleasure, but are rarely fellow human beings with their own sets of needs and desires.”135
Those traumatized children who are withdrawn or “spacey” alienate peers by their lack of engagement. These children may not pick up on cues to join in with others in the classroom or during breaks, and they may not know how to communicate appropriately with peers. Young children may engage in traumatic play that “may limit the flexibility of play for other developmental purposes” and which can alienate other children who do not understand and/or are “bored” by these repetitive patterns.136
Pynoos, Steinberg, and Goenjian explain that “re-enactment behavior, especially inappropriate sexual or aggressive behavior or aggression, may lead to a child’s being labeled ‘deviant’ by parents, teachers, and other children.”137 Sexually abused girls, for example, may have little experience with healthy, nonsexual encounters with males. Coming to sexual knowledge prematurely, these girls may relate to boys only in sexual terms, behavior that can stigmatize and isolate them.138 Furthermore, as students enter adolescence, “There may be an abrupt shift in [their] interpersonal attachments, including sudden dissolution or heightened attachment, increased identification with a peer group as a protective shield, and involvement in aberrant rather than mainstream relationships.”139
A Note on Special Education
Most children experiencing trauma will not develop diagnoses or disabilities that require special education, and this report is not recommending that every student be screened for trauma. However, some percentage will require special education and studies show that abused children are more likely to be in special education, have belowgrade-level achievement test scores, have poor work habits, and are 2.5 times more likely to fail a grade.140 When evaluating a student for special education, it is important to consider the possibility that trauma may be playing a role, as it is easy to inadvertently misdiagnose some of the trauma-related symptoms.

Case 2:18-cv-00939-MJP Document 1-3 Filed 06/26/18 Page 94 of 393
The I mpa c t o f Tra uma o n L e a r ning 41
The Trauma and Learning Policy Initiative is convening experts in trauma, neuropsychology, language, and education to develop forthcoming guidelines for making special education and non– special education evaluations, recommendations, and mental health consultations trauma-sensitive. The model will propose ways in which what is known about trauma can be incorporated into discussion about a child’s cognitive profile. The hope is that these guidelines will lead to better diagnoses on school-related matters, more appropriate special education and non–special education supports and accommodations for students, and, ultimately, less-restrictive placements.
Conclusion
It is important to remember that trauma is a reaction to an external event. At school, it is not always possible or appropriate to discover whether a child’s learning, relationships, and behavioral difficulties are trauma responses. However, by establishing a trauma-sensitive environment throughout the school and by being aware that exposure to violence might be at the heart of a child’s learning and behavioral difficulties, school professionals can help minimize the enduring effects of trauma even among those who have not been specifically identified. In cases where trauma is known, an understanding of its effects on learning and behavior will help educators plan the most effective responses.

Making School Environments Trauma-Sensitive

The Role of Schools in the Lives of Traumatized Children
Schools have an opportunity to ensure that family violence does not undermine children’s chances for educational success. The idea that school can moderate the effects of trauma is supported by research from both developmental psychologists and trauma experts.
For example, child-development psychologists Masten and Coatsworth explored the question of why many children develop competence even under adverse conditions, such as exposure to domestic violence, abuse, homelessness, war, and community violence. They found three key factors common to all competent children, whether or not they grow up in favorable circumstances:
1. a strong parent-child relationship, or, when such a relationship is not available, a surrogate caregiving figure who serves a mentoring role;
2. g ood cognitive skills, which predict academic success and lead to rule-abiding behavior; and
3. the ability to self-regulate attention, emotions, and behaviors.141
These authors explain that “poverty, chronic stress, domestic violence, natural disasters, and other high-risk contexts for child development may have lasting effects when they damage or impair these [three] crucial adaptive systems.”142 By the same token, they point out that bolstering these three key factors can help children be successful.143
Similarly, a white paper published by the National Child Traumatic Stress Network (NCTSN) Complex Trauma Task Force supports these conclusions. Among this Task Force’s proposals is their “ARC” model for working with traumatized children through both psychological intervention and school and community supports. The three elements of the ARC model are similar to the three factors Masten and

Case 2:18-cv-00939-MJP Document 1-3 Filed 06/26/18 Page 97 of 393
44 H e lp i ng Tra u m a t i zed C h i l d r en Lea r n
Coatsworth outline. The ARC model consists of:
1. b uilding secure Attachments between child and caregivers(s);
2. enhancing self-Regulatory capacities; and
3. increasing Competencies across multiple domains.144
Schools are uniquely positioned to help children reach their potential in each of the three areas identified by Masten and Coatsworth and the NCTSN. In particular, schools can:
n partner with families and strengthen traumatized children’s relationships with adults in and out of school;
n h elp children to modulate and self-regulate their emotions and behaviors; and
n enable children to develop their academic potential.
Masten and Coatsworth state:
If the goal is to change the competence of [at-risk] children, [multiple] strategies need to be considered ranging from efforts to change child capabilities (e.g., tutoring) to interventions directed at the context (e.g., parent education or school reform or opening of opportunities) to those directed at finding a better fit between a child and his or her context (e.g., changing schools).145
A Schoolwide Approach to Trauma-Sensitive Supports
In line with this recommendation, the Flexible Framework introduced below encourages the use of multiple strategies tailored to the needs of each school community and its individual students. Rather than advocating for one particular intervention or a one-size-fits-all approach, it offers tools for infusing trauma-sensitive perspectives and approaches throughout the school community and for ensuring that

Case 2:18-cv-00939-MJP Document 1-3 Filed 06/26/18 Page 98 of 393
The F lexible F ra mewo r k 45

mental health, academic and nonacademic individualized supports are sensitive to the needs of traumatized children. It is critical that these individual supports be provided within a context that recognizes the complexity of each child and of the traumatic experience.

For an example of how a successful schoolwide approach to trauma works, we can consider the case of the Ford Elementary School in Lynn, Massachusetts. The Ford School, under the direction of Dr. Claire Crane, has been widely recognized for improving dropout, suspension, and achievement rates in a high-poverty area. The school received funding in 2000 from a grant program created by the Massachusetts legislature entitled “Creating a Safe and Supportive Learning Environment: Serving
Youth Traumatized by Violence.” As part of the grant, the school trained its staff to respond to trauma symptoms. The story of George, a student at the Ford, demonstrates how the creation of a schoolwide trauma-sensitive context can revolutionize a traumatized child’s educational experience:

Every child has an area of strength in which he or she excels, whether it is in academics, art, music, or sports. When educators can identify and focus on a child’s strength, they afford the child the opportunity to experience success, with all the emotional implications of doing something well. This is an important starting point in mastering academic content and social relations, which in turn can serve as a basis for success at school.

George had lived with domestic violence—his mother had a series of boyfriends who were often abusive—and his behavior and academic performance were on the decline. His attendance at school was erratic. By the seventh grade, he was absent so often that the principal was on the verge of filing a truancy petition with juvenile court. The staff worried that he would drop out of school by 16—or be expelled.

Case 2:18-cv-00939-MJP Document 1-3 Filed 06/26/18 Page 99 of 393
46 H e lp i ng Tra u m a t i zed C h i l d r en Lea r n
Fortunately, the school had set up what they called their “trauma committee” to identify children whose actions might be symptoms of trauma at home. The staff had learned the importance of identifying students’ areas of strength as a strategy to reach difficult children. Staff came together for the sole purpose of identifying activities, talents, and interests of students who were not responding successfully in the classroom.
Home and school were stressful places for George, but he found solace on the baseball field. His homeroom teacher, Mr. Herman, had noticed his talent and on occasion went to the school field to watch the after-school pick-up game. He often mentioned something to George the next day about a nice catch or hit. Mr. Herman brought George’s skill in, and enjoyment of, baseball to the attention of the trauma committee.
Unfortunately, George’s grades had prohibited him from joining the school baseball team. Breaking with school policy, the trauma committee decided to approach George with an offer: he could join the team if he wrote a paper on why baseball was important to him. Then he would have to meet a further condition—he would have to keep his grades up if he wanted to stay on the team. George accepted, wrote a successful paper, and joined the team.
The recognition of George’s abilities led to a turnaround. His grades, behavior, and self-esteem improved. He stayed on the team and met all his academic requirements. As the principal proudly stated, “We would never call the court now.”
George’s story illustrates how a school can use its own resources to create a trauma-sensitive approach to solving a problem. Many traumatized children will need a more intensive intervention than George did, but, in all cases, providing support early on when it can do the most good is less costly and more effective than waiting for a child to fail, drop out, or become involved in the juvenile justice system.

The Flexible Framework: An Action Plan for Schools
The Flexible Framework that is described in this chapter can be adapted to the needs of any school community, regardless of organizational structure or educational philosophy. Designed to enable a school to develop its own trauma-sensitive institutional structure, the Framework provides guidelines for establishing schoolwide practices and supports for staff and students. The Framework has six key elements, each of which is to be evaluated from a trauma-sensitive perspective:
1. Schoolwide Infrastructure and Culture; II. Staff Training; III. Linking with Mental Health Professionals; IV. Academic Instruction for Traumatized Children; V. Nonacademic Strategies; and VI. School Policies, Procedures, and Protocols.
We hope that implementation of the schoolwide approaches that follow will in turn generate new strategies for enhancing and expanding the trauma-sensitive school environment. Although the Framework is designed for use at individual schools, several school districts are adapting it for use across their entire districts.
1. Schoolwide Infrastructure and Culture
A. Principal/Headmaster The senior administrator’s leadership role is to engage staff in the process and includes participating in strategic planning and helping staff identify ways to integrate trauma-sensitive routines into existing school operations.

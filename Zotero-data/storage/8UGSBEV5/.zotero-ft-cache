13

1. The States of Washington, California, Maryland, Oregon, New Mexico, New

14 Jersey, Iowa, Illinois, Minnesota, Rhode Island, New York, Vermont, North Carolina, and

15 Delaware; the Commonwealths of Massachusetts, Pennsylvania, and Virginia; and the District

16 of Columbia (collectively, the States) bring this action to protect the States and their residents

17 against the Trump Administration’s practice of refusing entry to asylum applicants who present
18 at Southwestern border ports of entry and its cruel and unlawful policy of forcibly separating
19
20 families who enter the country along our Southwestern border.

21

2. Widespread news reports, as well as interviews of detainees in Seattle and

22 elsewhere, confirm that families fleeing violence and persecution in their home countries who

23 try to present themselves at Southwestern ports of entry to seek asylum are being refused entry
24 into the United States. Border officials are unlawfully turning away these families on the pretext 25
that the United States is “full” or no longer accepting asylum seekers. This unlawful practice 26

1 exacerbates the trauma already suffered by refugee families while simultaneously artificially
2 increasing illegal entry violations. 3
3. For those families that do enter the United States along the Southwestern border, 4
immigration officials have implemented the Trump Administration’s policy of forcibly 5 6 separating parents from their children – regardless of the family’s circumstances or the needs of
7 the children. As of June 20, 2018, the new policy had already resulted in the separation of over

8 two thousand children from their parents at the Southwestern border, most recently at a rate of

9 50-70 families separated every day. Defendants have taken children as young as infants from
10 their parents, often with no warning or opportunity to say goodbye, and providing no information 11
about where the children are being taken or when they will next see each other. The States’ 12
interviews of detainees in their respective jurisdictions confirm the gratuitous harm that this 13
14 policy inflicts on parents and children and the immediate and deleterious impact it has on
15 families and communities.

16

4. As of June 25, 2018, emerging reports suggest that immigration officials are now

17 using the children taken from their parents as leverage to coerce parents to withdraw their asylum
18 claims.
19 5. Defendants have repeatedly and publicly admitted that a policy of intentionally
20 separating immigrant children from their parents would be “cruel, “horrible,” and “antithetical
21
22 to child welfare.” But they have alternately claimed that they have no such policy, or that it is

23 somehow mandated by federal law or prior court decisions.

24

6. In truth, however, Defendants have embraced a policy of separating parents from

25 their children for the express purpose of deterring immigration along the Southwestern border 26

1 (the “Policy”). No law or court decision requires such separation. Rather, Defendants have

2 chosen to adopt the Policy as part of their “zero tolerance” or “100 percent prosecution” approach
3 to individuals who enter the country unlawfully, irrespective of circumstances, and to then use
4 such misdemeanor criminal charges to detain parents indefinitely in federal facilities that cannot
5
6 accommodate families.

7

7. Hundreds of children are left to languish in makeshift detention facilities – where

8 staff are sometimes told not to comfort them – until a placement is found for the child.

9 Defendants have moved the children and parents to different locations all over the country. While
10 the parents are held in federal facilities to await further immigration proceedings, their children 11
are sent elsewhere to group shelters or family placements. 12
8. Defendants have made clear that the purpose of separating families is not to 13
14 protect children, but rather to create a public spectacle designed to deter potential immigrants
15 from coming to the United States. As Counselor to the President Kellyanne Conway said

16 recently: “Nobody likes seeing babies ripped from their mothers’ arms . . . but we have to make

17 sure that DHS’ laws are understood through the soundbite culture that we live in.” KellyAnne

22 intentional, and permanent trauma to the children and parents who are separated in furtherance

23 of an illegitimate deterrence objective.

24

9. On June 20, 2018, President Trump signed an Executive Order purporting to

25 suspend the Policy, but any relief offered by the Order is illusory. The Order says nothing about 26

1 reuniting the families already ripped apart by the federal government, and Trump Administration
2 officials have made clear the Order will have no impact on the thousands of families who have 3
already been traumatized. 4
10. Moreover, based on its text and contemporaneous statements by Administration 5 6 officials, it is clear the Order does not require the end of family separation. In fact, the
7 Administration currently lacks both the capacity and the legal authority to detain families

8 together for indefinite periods of time, which is what the Order contemplates as the alternative

9 to separating families.

10

11. On June 21, 2018, as required by the Order, Attorney General Sessions filed an

11 Ex Parte Application for relief from the Flores Settlement (a 1997 agreement which sets national
12
standards regarding the detention, release, and treatment of all children in DHS custody). That 13

14 request seeks rescission of Flores’ protections so that families may be detained indefinitely

15 during the pendency of any immigration proceedings involving their members, a plan that raises

16 the specter of internment camps.

17

12. Moreover, the Flores application seeks a “determin[ation] that the Agreement’s

18 state licensure requirement does not apply to ICE family residential facilities.” The government’s
19 attempt to modify the Flores settlement terms by removing States’ licensing authority and
20
jurisdiction over such facilities is a direct attack on the States’ sovereign powers. 21

22

13. Neither the Order nor the Administration’s Flores application offer any assurance

23 that the Administration will not return to a family separation policy when its efforts to intern

24 families together fail. In response to the public outcry against family separation, in recent days 25 President Trump has proposed that Homeland Security simply deport immigrants without 26

1 hearing or legal process instead of, or perhaps in addition to, interning thousands of families in
2 military facilities. 3
14. The Policy, and the Trump Administration’s subsequent attempt to shield their 4
facilities from state licensing standards, is an affront to States’ sovereign interests in enforcing 5 6 their laws governing minimum standards of care for children, declaring the family unit to be a
7 fundamental resource of American life that should be nurtured, and requiring the preservation of
8 the parent-child relationship unless the child’s right to basic nurture, health, or safety is
9 jeopardized. The Policy also adversely affects the States’ proprietary interests, forcing States to
10 expend resources to remediate the harms inflicted by the Policy, some of which are likely to be 11
permanent. State programs, including child welfare services, social and health services, courts, 12
and public schools are all experiencing fiscal impacts due to family separation that will only 13 14 increase. The Policy, and the Administration’s related conduct, has caused severe and immediate
15 harm to the States and their residents, including parents who are detained, released, or otherwise
16 reside in the States after being forcibly separated from their children; children who are placed in
17 facilities, shelters, sponsor homes, foster care, or who otherwise reside in the States after being 18
separated from their parents; extended families and sponsors in the States; and the States’ 19
immigrant communities. 20
15. The Court should declare the practice of refusing to accept asylum seekers who 21 22 present at Southwestern points of entry and the related Policy of family separation illegal and
23 order Defendants to stop implementing them immediately. The Court should order Defendants
24 to reunite every family separated by these unlawful acts immediately, and to take such other
25 actions as are warranted by the time of hearing. Defendants’ conduct has caused real harms to 26

5
6 States’ sovereign immunity is waived by 5 U.S.C. § 702.

7

17. Venue is proper in this district pursuant to 28 U.S.C. §§ 1391(b)(2) and

8 1391(e)(1). Defendants are the United States of America and United States agencies or officers

9 sued in their official capacities. The State of Washington is a resident of this judicial district, and
10 a substantial part of the events or omissions giving rise to this Complaint occurred within the 11
Western District of Washington. For example, as of June 18, 2018, parents who were recently 12
refused entry and then victimized by the Policy were being detained at the Federal Detention 13
14 Center – SeaTac, which is located in King County. At that time, a number of children who were
15 separated from their parents pursuant to the Policy also were being detained in Seattle and other

16 nearby locations.

18. The States bring this action to redress harms to their sovereign, proprietary, and

18 parens patriae interests.

7 sovereign, proprietary, and quasi-sovereign interests.

8

21. Nothing in the June 20 Executive Order remedies these harms, and the June 21

IV. ALLEGATIONS
Federal Immigration Policy Has Traditionally Emphasized Family Reunification, Recognizing that Children Belong with their Families

6

36. When DHS, typically through ICE or CBP, detains an undocumented child who

7 is traveling alone, i.e., unaccompanied by a parent, the relevant federal agencies follow an
8 established process. Specifically, ICE or CBP may detain an unaccompanied alien child (UAC)
9
for up to 72 hours, as other federal agencies locate an appropriate shelter facility for that child. 10

11 8 U.S.C. § 1232(b)(3). ICE or CBP then must turn the child over to the ORR for shelter

12 placement. Id.

13

37. Once in ORR custody, children are placed in ORR-funded and supervised

14 shelters, where staff must attempt to locate a parent and determine if family reunification is
15 possible. If ORR is unable to find a parent, ORR staff will try to locate another family member,
16 relative, family friend, or caretaker in the United States to serve as a sponsor who can care for
17
18 the child during the pendency of any subsequent immigration proceeding.

19

38. Unaccompanied children in ORR custody for whom no sponsor placement can

20 be made are moved to secondary ORR-contracted and state-licensed group care facilities, which

21 can be anywhere in the country. In such cases, if ORR assesses that the child has a pathway to
22 legal immigration status, ORR will place the child in an ORR-contracted and state-licensed long 23
term foster care program while the immigration process continues. If ORR determines that a 24
pathway does not exist, the child may remain in a shelter or ORR-contracted and state-licensed 25
26 group care during removal proceedings.

39. Thus, unaccompanied children typically arrive in the individual states in three

2 ways: they may be placed initially in a state-licensed shelter located in the state while ORR
3 determines if a family member can be found in the country; they may arrive when ORR releases
4 them to the care of an in-state sponsor while their immigration proceeding goes forward; or they
5
6 can be moved into a placement in an ORR-contracted and state-licensed long term foster care

7 program as they await their immigration proceeding.

8

40. While ORR’s initial shelter care placement and long term foster care programs

9 are largely federally funded, an unaccompanied child’s in-state placements impose burdens on

10 the receiving state, discussed below. 11

After Almost a Year of Threats, Defendants Adopted an Official Policy of Separating Families Who Cross the Southwestern Border, Creating a New Class of “Unaccompanied” Children

14

41. For over a year, the Trump Administration has made clear in numerous public

15 statements that it was considering an official Policy to separate families at the Southwestern
16 border in an effort to deter immigrants from Latin America from coming to the United States. 17
42. As early as March 2017, a senior DHS official stated that Defendants were 18
considering a proposal to separate children from their parents at the Southwestern border. See 19 20 Mary Kay Mallonee, DHS Considering Proposal to Separate Children From Adults at Border

22 border/, attached hereto as Ex. 2.

23

43. On March 7, 2017, John Kelly, the then-Secretary of DHS, confirmed that DHS

24 was considering a policy of separating children from their parents: “I am considering that. They
25 will be well cared for as we deal with their parents.” See Daniella Diaz, Kelly: DHS Considering

2 concerned that DHS was carrying out “a systematic and blanket policy to separate a child from
3 a parent” upon arrival to the United States—a policy the Senators condemned as “cruel” and

9

48. In the spring of 2018, an influx of families seeking to enter the United States may

10 have catalyzed the Administration to finally embrace the Policy. In March and April of 2018,

10 numbers of Latino immigrants at the Southwestern border in March and April of 2018 was the
11 impetus for publicly adopting the Policy. See Ex. 5. When asked what had changed since the
12 prior year – when the Administration backed away from adopting such a policy – the person
13
14 pointed to the President: “What you’re seeing now is a President’s frustration with the fact that

15 the numbers are back up.” Id.

16

51. In early April 2018, President Trump reportedly expressed frustration with DHS

17 Secretary Nielsen for failing to stop or decrease immigration at the Southwestern border. Several
18 officials stated that one persistent issue was President Trump’s belief that Secretary Nielsen and
19 DHS were resisting his direction that parents be separated from their children when crossing
20 unlawfully at the US-Mexico border. See Shear and Pearlroth, Kirstjen Nielsen, Chief of

52. On April 6, 2018, President Trump issued a memorandum directing Attorney 4
General Sessions and DHS Secretary Nielsen to detail all measures and identify any resources 5 6 or steps “needed to expeditiously end ‘catch and release’ practices” that allow undocumented
7 immigrants to be released into the community pending resolution of their immigration cases.

53. That same day, Attorney General Sessions formally announced a

9 “zero-tolerance” policy “for offenses under 8 U.S.C. § 1325(a), which prohibits both attempted

10 illegal entry and illegal entry into the United States by an alien.” See Attorney General

54. In a memorandum also issued April 6, Attorney General Sessions “direct[ed] each

16 United States Attorney’s Office along the Southwest Border . . . to adopt immediately a

17 zero-tolerance policy for all offenses referred for prosecution under section 1325(a)” and made
18 clear that this directive “superseded any existing policy.” See Memorandum for Federal
19 Prosecutors Along the Southwest Border (April 6, 2018), attached hereto as Ex. 13.
20 55. On May 7, 2018, DHS adopted an official Policy of “referring 100 percent of
21
22 illegal Southwest Border crossings to the Department of Justice for prosecution,” and Attorney

23 General Sessions publicized that children would be automatically separated from parents or other

24 adults with whom they were traveling. See Attorney General Sessions Delivers Remarks 25 Discussing the Immigration Enforcement Actions of the Trump Administration, Justice News 26

56. With that, Attorney General Sessions and Secretary Nielsen carried out President 4
Trump’s directive: Under the new federal law enforcement priority, all undocumented adults 5 6 crossing the U.S.-Mexico border at unauthorized locations would be referred by DHS to the
7 Department of Justice. DOJ would then charge each adult with misdemeanor illegal entry or

8 reentry. Everyone so referred would be prosecuted and detained regardless of familial

9 circumstances or asylum claims, and children would be automatically separated from their

10 parents and transferred to the custody of ORR for placement elsewhere.
11 57. Accordingly, Defendants have thus created a new category of “unaccompanied”
12 children – those who came into the country with a parent but were, pursuant to the Policy,
13
14 forcibly separated by ICE or CBP immediately thereafter.

15

58. Perhaps emboldened by the directive, DHS officers at ports of entry along the

16 Southwestern border have been refusing to let immigrants present themselves and request

17 asylum, turning people away because the United States is “full.” See Alfredo Corchado, Asylum

60. Recent interviews with detained parents held in federal facilities in Seattle

8 confirm these reports. For example, one mother presented herself and her 15-year old son at the

9 Laredo, Texas port of entry and requested asylum for herself and safe passage for her American-
10 citizen son. Officials at the port of entry detained her, separated her from her son, and told her 11
that the United Sates “will not give [her] asylum” and that she “w[ould] not see [her] son again 12
until he turns 18” because he would be taken to a shelter or given to an American family for 13
14 adoption. Another mother claiming asylum was told, in front of her 14-year-old daughter, that
15 she would be “punished with jail time” for having come to the United States.

16

61. The effect of this conduct is an increasing influx of entrants at locations other

17 than ports of entry, which Defendants construe as violations of 8 U.S.C. § 1325 and its

18 implementing regulations. The adults are then routed into the criminal system while the children
19 are turned over to ORR for placement – thereby separating the family and implementing the
20
Policy. 21

22

62. Since announcing the Policy, Defendants have repeatedly acknowledged its

23 existence and cruelty. For example, President Trump, tweeting on May 26, 2018, referred to the

24 Policy as a “horrible law.” The May 26, 2018 tweet is attached hereto as Ex. 16. 25

65. On June 17, 2018, Counselor to the President Kellyanne Conway acknowledged

8 C. The President’s Executive Order Does Not End Family Separation

9

72. On June 20, 2018, President Trump issued an Executive Order entitled,

10 “Affording Congress an Opportunity to Address Family Separation” (the Order). The Order is
11 attached hereto as Ex. 24. While purporting to suspend the practice of separating families, the
12 Order offers illusory relief. Indeed, the language of the Order itself does not actually require an
13
14 end to family separation, and in fact, it implicitly recognizes that the Policy will continue.

15

73. By its own terms, the Order states that it does not confer any enforceable right or

16 benefit on any person.

17

74. The Order appears to direct the Secretary of Homeland Security to detain families

18 together “during the pendency of any criminal proceedings for improper entry or immigration
19 proceedings involving their members,” while continuing the practice of prosecuting and
20
detaining all unauthorized border crossers. 21

22

75. At the same time, the Order acknowledges that Defendants do not have the

23 resources or facilities necessary to effectuate its terms. Indeed, every provision of the Order is

24 to be carried out only “where appropriate and consistent with law and available resources.” 25 These terms are undefined, leaving familial detention largely discretionary. Likewise, the Order 26

206-464-7744

Case 2:18-cv-00939-MJP Document 1 Filed 06/26/18 Page 21 of 128

1 repeatedly affirms that family unity is “subject to the availability of appropriations,” but provides
2 no parameters on when appropriations will be sought or even how much funding is needed. 3
76. Similarly, the Order directs the Secretary of Defense to provide existing available 4
facilities to house immigrant families, or to construct them, but again there is no indication that 5 6 appropriate federal facilities exist and are available, or that construction of new family
7 internment facilities is feasible.

8

77. The Order also acknowledges that Defendants cannot lawfully carry out its terms

9 until they receive a court order “that would permit” the family detention scheme contemplated.

10 Because almost every provision in the Order is subject to the availability of non-existent

11 resources and legal authority for indefinite detention that is contrary to settled law, it fails to
12
provide any actual relief. 13

14

78. The Order also is silent as to the thousands of families already separated by the

15 Policy. It does nothing to require their reunification or redress the harms inflicted on those

16 families. As a spokesperson for HHS’ Administration for Children and Families explained,

17 “There will not be a grandfathering of existing cases … I can tell you definitively that is going
18 to be policy.” See Michael D. Shear, Abby Goodnough and Maggie Haberman, Trump Retreats

80. Likewise, just days prior to issuance of the Order, Defendants stated numerous 13
14 times their position that only Congress could end a policy of separating families. For example,
15 on June 18, 2018, Secretary Nielsen announced: “Until these loopholes are closed by Congress,

16 it is not possible, as a matter of law, to detain and remove whole family units who arrive illegally

17 in the United States. Congress and the courts created this problem, and Congress alone can fix
18 it. Until then, we will enforce every law we have on the books to defend the sovereignty and
19 security of the United States.” See Matthew Nussbaum, Trump falsely claimed for days that he

1 to enforce it, and we would like to see Congress fix it. That’s why the President has repeatedly
2 called on them to work with him to do just that.” Id. 3
82. And on June 20, 2018, contemporaneous with announcing the Order, Vice 4
President Pence claimed that changing the law was the only way to end family separation: “I 5 6 think the American people want the Democrats to stop the obstruction, to stop standing in the
7 way of the kind of reforms at our border that will end the crisis of illegal immigration. We can
8 solve this issue of separation.” See Vice President Mike Pence: Democrats Can Fix Family

10 president-mike-pence-democrats-can-fix-family-separation-border, attached hereto as Ex. 28. 11
83. When President Trump signed the Order, Vice President Pence and Secretary 12
Nielsen again called on Congress to end separating families at the border; Vice President Pence 13 14 suggested that the Order is only applicable “in the immediate days forward” and “call[ed] on
15 Congress to change the laws” for a more permanent fix. See clip at https://www.c-

counselor to Attorney General Sessions, sidestepped a question about whether a family that 20
crosses the border now would be separated, stating that an “implementation phase” would occur, 21 22 but that he was not sure precisely what DHS or HHS would do in the immediate future. Mr.
23 Hamilton echoed President Trump’s, Nielsen’s, and Sessions’ statements that “Congress needs
24 to provide a permanent fix for this situation.” Mr. Hamilton stated that if Congress does not act,

Pursuant to the Order, the Attorney General Has Launched an Attack on State Sovereignty

6

85. The Order directs the Attorney General to “promptly file a request with the U.S.

7 District Court for the Central District of California to modify the Settlement Agreement in Flores
8
v. Sessions,” making rescission of Flores’ protections a predicate to the maintenance of family 9

10 unity.

11

86. The Flores Agreement, which has been in place since 1997, “sets out nationwide

12 policy for the detention, release, and treatment of minors in the custody of the INS,” including

13 both accompanied and unaccompanied minors. Stipulated Settlement Agreement, ¶ 9, attached

14 hereto as Ex. 30. Among other things, Flores prevents the DHS from detaining children in
15 restricted facilities for long periods and it requires federal detention centers to meet state
16
licensing requirements for childcare facilities. 17

18

87. As Vice President Pence previously conceded, the Flores agreement provides

19 only two options for the long term placement of families—(1) parental detention and family

20 separation, or (2) keeping families together, by releasing them into the community. See clip
21 available at https://www.c-span.org/video/?c4736625/pence-options-law). 22
88. On June 21, 2018, Attorney General Sessions filed an ex parte application 23
seeking relief from the Flores Settlement Agreement to allow the federal government to detain 24 25 families indefinitely at non-licensed facilities. Flores, et al. v. Sessions, et al., Case No. CV 85-

89. In his application, Attorney General Sessions admits that mass internment of

2 families by the federal government is currently illegal: “this Court’s construction of the Flores
3 Settlement Agreement eliminates the practical availability of family detention across the nation
4 . .” Ex. 31 at 2. “Under current law and legal rulings, including this Court’s, it is not possible
5
6 for the U.S. government to detain families together during the pendency of their immigration

7 proceedings. It cannot be done.” Id. at 3.

8

90. Nevertheless, Attorney General Sessions argues that indefinitely detaining

9 families is necessary for deterrence. Specifically, he asserts that, without family detention, there
10 is “a powerful incentive for aliens to enter this country with children.” Id. at 1. Attorney General 11
Session claims that, “[u]ndeniably the limitation on the option of detaining families together and 12
marked increase of families illegally crossing the border are linked.” Id. at 2. “‘[D]etaining 13
14 these individuals dispels such expectations, and deters others from unlawfully coming to the
15 United States.’” Id. at 13 (internal citations omitted).

16

91. Attorney General Sessions also requests an exemption from state licensing

17 requirements, “because of ongoing and unresolved disputes over the ability of States to license
18 these types of facilities.” Ex. 31 at 17-18.
19 92. The district court and the Ninth Circuit in Flores rejected almost identical
20 arguments advanced by the federal government in 2015. See Flores v. Lynch, 212 F. Supp. 3d
21
22 907, 913 (C.D. Cal. 2015), aff’d in part, rev’d in part and remanded, 828 F.3d 898 (9th Cir.

23 2016); Flores v. Lynch, 828 F.3d 898, 910 (9th Cir. 2016). At that time, the government

24 requested that the trial court modify the Flores agreement to allow DHS to hold female-headed 25 families with their children indefinitely in family detention centers in Texas and New Mexico. 26

1 Rather than grant that request, the district court confirmed that Flores requires that “Defendants
2 must house children who are not released in a non-secure facility that is licensed by an 3
appropriate state agency to care for dependent children.” Case No. CV 85-4544-DMG (C.D. 4
Cal.), Dkt. 177 at 12. The court stated: “The fact that the [Texas and New Mexico] family 5 6 residential centers cannot be licensed by an appropriate state agency simply means that, under
7 the Agreement, [children] … cannot be housed in these facilities except as permitted by the

8 Agreement.” Id. at 12-13.

12 [would] deter[] others who would have come.” Case No. CV 85-4544-DMG (C.D. Cal.), Dkt.

15 . . . and, even if the parties did not anticipate an influx of this size, we cannot fathom how a

16 ‘suitably tailored’ response to the change in circumstances would be to exempt an entire category

17 of migrants from the Settlement, as opposed to, say, relaxing certain requirements applicable to

18 all migrants.” Flores v. Lynch, 828 F.3d 898, 910 (9th Cir. 2016).

23 families together fail.

15 separating them from their children due to lack of resources, but that he and his agency are

100. Emerging reports as of June 25, 2018, suggest that immigration officials are using

17 claims. The family reunification Fact Sheet released by the Department of Homeland Security
18 on June 23, 2018, provides for family reunification only for adults “who are subject to removal”
19 so that they may be “reunited with their children for the purposes of removal.” See Fact Sheet:

103. In recent days, President Trump has proposed deporting immigrants without 4

7 we should be changing our laws, building the Wall, hire Border Agents and Ice and not let people

8 come into our country based on the legal phrase they are told to say as their password.” See

10

104. On June 24, 2018, President Trump again proposed that immigrants who cross

11 into the United States should be sent back immediately without due process or an appearance
12
before a judge: “We cannot allow all of these people to invade our Country. When somebody 13

14 comes in, we must immediately, with no Judges or Court Cases, bring them back from where

15 they came. Our system is a mockery to good immigration policy and Law and Order. Most

confirmed that CPB’s halt of prosecution referrals “is a temporary solution. This isn’t going to 5 6 last. . . This will only last a short amount of time, because we’re going to run out of space, we’re
7 going to run out of resources to keep people together.” Secretary Sanders reiterated: “We’re

8 not changing the policy . . . We’re simply out of resources. And at some point, Congress has to

9 do what they were elected to do, and that is secure our border, that is stop the crime coming into
10 our country.” Secretary Sanders dodged questions regarding President Trump’s recent 11
suggestion that immigrants be afforded no due hearing or due process prior to deportation. See 12

16 F. Defendants’ Policy Causes Devastating Harm To Children and Parents

17

107. Separating families when a child’s safety is not at risk causes immediate, acute

18 trauma as well as foreseeable long term damage and harm to both the parents and the children.

19 The negative effects and consequences of the Policy are likely to be long-lasting and in some
20 cases debilitating.
21

22

108. Unless required to protect a child’s safety, forced separation from their parents is

23 likely to cause immediate and extreme psychological harm to young children, and the resulting

24 cognitive and emotional damage can be permanent. Parental separation is a traumatic loss for

25 the child; as a result they are likely to experience post-traumatic symptoms such as nightmares, 26

1 and other manifestations of anxiety and depression, all of which are likely to increase in severity

2 the longer the separation lasts and lead to the potential development of problematic coping

3 strategies in both the near and long term. This trauma may be exacerbated for children who are
4 fleeing persecution or violence in their home countries.
5

6

109. Observations by those who have seen children recently separated pursuant to

7 Defendants’ Policy suggest that conditions created by Defendants will further exacerbate the

8 separation trauma. By way of example, after touring a shelter along the Texas border to Mexico,

9 Dr. Colleen Kraft, President of the American Academy of Pediatrics, described a “screaming”
10 girl, “no older than 2” who could not be comforted because shelter workers had been told they 11
are not allowed to touch the children, not even to hold a crying child and convey some semblance 12
of compassion. See Immigrant children: What a doctor saw in a Texas shelter, The Washington 13
14 Post (June 17, 2018) available at https://www.washingtonpost.com/news/post-
15 nation/wp/2018/06/16/america-is-better-than-this-what-a-doctor-saw-in-a-texas-shelter-for-

16 migrant-children/?utm_term=.e1e5566675e9, attached hereto as Ex. 42.

17

110. These reports are also consistent with the observations of State employees who

18 recently interviewed separated children living in Seattle. Every child displayed significant
19 distress when relaying their experience and broke down when describing their separation. Some
20
reported ongoing nightmares, others were so traumatized they could not continue the brief 21

22 interviews.

23

111. Similarly, parents who arrive together with their children at the U.S. border and

24 then are separated from their children by the U.S. government are likely to experience immediate 25 and acute psychological injury as a result. Under the Policy, many parents are being separated 26

1 from their children suddenly without the chance to prepare the child or even say goodbye,

2 without knowing where they or their children will be taken, without any guarantee of
3 reunification, and often without contact with their children or with long gaps in that contact.
4 When parents and children are allowed to speak, it is only briefly – ten minutes or so – by
5
6 telephone.

7

112. These otherwise fit parents are likely to experience deterioration of their mental

8 and physical health in the aftermath of the forcible separation from their children with symptoms

9 including anxiety, depression, PTSD, and other trauma-related disorders. In some cases, parental
10 trauma from separation from their children will become unbearable because their available 11
coping mechanisms may be overwhelmed by the sudden loss of the important role of parent and 12
protector of the child. Indeed, at least one parent, distraught after officials pried his 3-year-old 13
14 son from his arms, is reported to have committed suicide following the separation. See Nick
15 Miroff, A family separated at the border, and this distraught father took his own life, (June 9,

16 2018) available at https://www.washingtonpost.com/world/national-security/a-family-was-

20 113. These general observations were confirmed by interviewers who recently spoke
21
22 with mothers detained in a federal facility in King County, Washington. The mothers were

23 visibly upset, with some expressing panic and desperation, because they lacked information

24 about their children’s safety and did not know whether or when they would see their children 25 again. 26

The Policy Is Expressly Intended to Use Traumatized Children and Families to Deter Migration of Latina/o Immigrants and for Political Leverage
114. Defendants have changed public positions on the Policy numerous times over the

4 last few weeks, but what has remained consistent throughout is Defendants’ unambiguous

5 adoption of a policy at the Southwestern border that uses trauma as deterrence, and their

6 insistence that Congress overhaul immigration laws to codify President Trump’s immigration
7 agenda, including building a wall at the U.S.-Mexico border. See JM Rieger, The Trump

13 contradictory statements). Confirmation of these two goals is reflected in statements from a year
14 ago and continued even after issuance of the Executive Order. 15
115. As early as March 7, 2017, then-Secretary of DHS John Kelly confirmed that the 16
Policy was intended to “to deter movement” along the Southwestern border. See Ex. 3. Later 17 18 that year, a source who attended a DHS meeting to discuss ways to “deter immigrants from
19 coming to the U.S. illegally” reported that the Policy was still being considered, but kept getting

20 “bogged down” because of how “difficult and controversial it was.” See Ex. 4.

21

116. On December 5, 2017, Kirstjen Nielsen replaced John Kelly as DHS Secretary.

22

117. On February 8, 2018, 75 members of Congress wrote a letter to DHS Secretary

23 Nielsen expressing “deep[] concern that the Department of Homeland Security (DHS) is
24
separating families, including parents and their minor children . . . along the U.S.-Mexico 25

26 border.” DHS’ “reported justification of this practice as a deterrent to family migration suggests

1 a lack of understanding about the violence many families are fleeing in their home countries”
2 and “[m]ore pointedly, the pretext of deterrence is not a legally sufficient basis for separating 3
families.” The letter is attached hereto as Ex. 45. 4
118. The letter details two complaints filed in December 2017 that confirmed DHS 5 6 was “intentionally separating families for purposes of deterrence and punishment.” In particular,
7 the second complaint documented “instances of infants and toddlers as young as one and two

8 years old separated from their parents and rendered ‘unaccompanied’”—among these was “a

9 father separated from his one-year-old son, Mateo, despite presenting appropriate documents to
10 establish their relationship.” Id. 11
119. Attorney General Sessions has confirmed that the Policy is intended to deter other 12
families from entering the United States. For example, on April 6, 2018, he issued a warning to 13
14 immigrants crossing the Southwestern border that “illegally entering this country will not be
15 rewarded, but instead will be met with the full prosecutorial powers of the Department of Justice”

16 and children “will be separated from [their parents].” See Ex. 12.

17

120. In May 2018, DHS announced the results of its pilot at the El Paso border sector

18 from July to November 2017. Its report—later found to be inaccurate—further confirms that
19 deterrence is the primary purpose of the Policy. When asked about the Policy, DHS reported that
20
“[t]he number of illegal crossings between ports of entry of family units dropped by 64 percent. 21

22 This decrease was attributed to the prosecution of adults amenable to prosecution for illegal entry

23 while risking the lives of their children. Of note, the numbers began rising again after the

24 initiative was paused.” See Ex. 6. Notably, public reporting suggests that, based on DHS’ own 25 statistics, these numbers are wrong and that there was, in fact, a 64% increase in apprehensions. 26

They’re not criminals. They’re not MS-13. . . . They’re not bad people. They’re coming here 12

127. On June 18, 2018, President Trump complained that “[w]e have the worst

11 immigration laws in the entire world. Nobody has such sad, such bad and actually, in many
12
cases, such horrible and tough – you see about child separation, you see what’s going on there.” 13

14 See Ex. 19. He suggested, “[i]f the Democrats would sit down, instead of obstructing, we could

15 have something done very quickly, good for the children, good for the country, good for the

16 world. It could take place quickly.” Id. But in the meantime, he stated, “The United States

17 will not be a migrant camp and it will not be a refugee holding facility, it won’t be.” Id.
18 128. On June 18, 2018, in remarks before the National Sheriffs’ Association, Attorney
19 General Sessions also suggested that if lawmakers would simply acquiesce to President Trump’s
20 demands to fund a wall on the Southwestern border, Defendants would stop separating families:
21
22 “We do not want to separate parents from their children,” “[i]f we build the wall, if we pass

23 legislation to end the lawlessness, we won’t face these terrible choices.” See Ex. 20.

Defendants’ Family Separation Policy Targets Immigrant Families Based on Their National Origin

5

130. Defendants’ Policy is directed only at “Southwest Border crossings” (see Ex. 13),

6 the majority of which consist of immigrants from Latin America. Indeed, in its reports on recent
7 “Southwest Border Apprehensions,” CBP only tracks family unit apprehensions for immigrants
8 from El Salvador, Guatemala, Honduras, and Mexico. See U.S. Border Patrol Southwest Border
9 Apprehensions by Sector FY2018, available at https://www.cbp.gov/newsroom/stats/usbp-sw-
10
11 border-apprehensions, attached hereto as Ex. 54. Defendants do not track whether the Policy is

12 impacting family unit migration from any other countries.

13

131. Defendants’ stated rationale for adopting the Policy—i.e., to deter migration—is

14 ineffective and not a legitimate law enforcement tactic. Rather than deter migration, the number
15 of families and unaccompanied children apprehended has steadily increased since Defendants
16 have implemented the Policy. According to Defendants’ own statistics, in March 2018, the
17
18 number of families apprehended at the Southwestern border was 37,385; in April 2018, 38,278;

19 and in May 2018, 40,344. See Ex. 8. The number of family units arriving at ports of entry

20 determined to be inadmissible also stayed relatively stable; in March 2018, the number was

21 5,162, in April, 5,445, and in May 4,718. Id.

22

132. Defendants also report that U.S. border agents made more than 50,000 arrests in

23 each of the months of March, April and May 2018—“an indication that escalating enforcement
24
tactics by the Trump Administration—including separating immigrant parents from their 25

26 children—has not had an immediate deterrent effect.” See Nick Miroff, Border arrests exceed

133. On May 23, 2018, Steven Wagner, Acting Secretary of the Administration for

7 Children and Families testified before a Senate committee, stating: “In FY 2017, 84 percent of

8 [unaccompanied alien minors] referred to ORR came from Honduras, Guatemala, and

9 El Salvador. To date in FY 2018, 93 percent of referred children come from those countries.” A
10 copy of the Wagner Statement is attached as Ex. 56. 11
134. On April 6, 2018, President Trump signed a memorandum ordering agencies to 12
“expeditiously end” the practice of “catch and release,” a pejorative phrase that refers to the 13
14 practice of allowing immigrants to be released into the community pending resolution of their
15 immigration cases. See Jesse Byrnes, Trump signs memo ordering end to ‘catch and release”

16 practices, The Hill, available at http://thehill.com/homenews/administration/382054-trump-

21
22 facilities, that could be used, modified, or repurposed to detain aliens for violations of

23 immigration law” and specifically directs Attorney General Sessions and DHS Secretary

24 Nielsen to identify any resources “that may be needed to expeditiously end ‘catch and release’ 25 practices.” Id. 26

135. The Policy—announced shortly thereafter—targets only the immigrants at the

2 Southwestern border, the vast majority of whom are from Latin American countries. See Ex. 12.
3 136. In stark contrast to Defendants’ Southwestern border actions, DHS’ updated
4 Northern Border Strategy, announced on June 12, 2018, aims “to facilitate the flow of lawful
5
6 cross-border trade and travel, and strengthen cross-border community resilience.” Although the

7 Northern Border Strategy is intended, in part, to “safeguard our northern border against terrorist

8 and criminal threats,” the strategy does not demand prosecution and family separation for all

9 unauthorized entrants at the northern border of the United States. See Department of Homeland

137. The Policy is intended to target immigrants by their country of origin and is

15 consistent with the demonstrated anti-Latina/o bias repeatedly shown by President Trump.

16

138. Members of the Trump Administration repeatedly disparaged Latin American

17 countries during the presidential campaign and during the Trump presidency. When Mr. Trump
18 announced his campaign at Trump Tower in June 2015, he announced: “When Mexico sends its
19 people, they’re not sending their best. . . . They’re bringing drugs. They’re bringing crime.
20 They’re rapists.” See Z. Byron Wolf, Trump basically called Mexicans rapists again, available

sheriff who oversaw operations that consistently targeted and harassed Latino residents in 13 14 Maricopa County. After a thorough investigation, the U.S. Department of Justice issued a report

16 alia, conducting immigration sweeps that routinely violated the Fourth Amendment; detaining
17 Latino residents based on fabricated charges; placing Spanish-speaking inmates in solitary 18
confinement as punishment for not speaking English; refusing to accept requests for basic 19

to Latino inmates as “wetback,” “Mexican bitches,” and “stupid Mexicans.” See Letter/Report, 21 22 attached hereto as Ex. 71. The report found that Mr. Arpaio’s own actions “promoted a culture

Policy. On June 12, 2018, the American Bar Association (ABA) expressed “strong opposition” 5 6 to Defendants’ “separation of children from their parents when arriving at the southern border,”
7 calling the practice “unfair, inhumane, and, in the end, ineffective.” See ABA letter attached

9 deterrent for migrant parents” at the Southwestern border, and “that family separation is not a
10 collateral consequence of regular law enforcement” but “an explicitly intentional goal.”). 11
159. The Policy has also been widely condemned by the medical community. For 12
example, the American Association of Pediatrics (AAP) recently denounced Defendants’ Policy, 13 14 writing: “Separating children from their parents contradicts everything we stand for as
15 pediatricians – protecting and promoting children’s health. In fact, highly stressful experiences,
16 like family separation, can cause irreparable harm, disrupting a child’s brain architecture and
17 affecting his or her health. This type of prolonged exposure to serious stress - known as toxic 18

1 J. Defendants’ Policy Harms the States’ Sovereign Interests

2

164. Defendants’ Policy and subsequent actions harm the States’ sovereign interests

3 by interfering with their licensing authority and rendering the States unable to honor their own
4 policies favoring family unity.
5

6

165. Even for residential facilities that are federally funded, States have sovereign

7 responsibility for the licensing, inspection, and monitoring of out-of-home care providers (i.e.,

8 providers who care for children away from their parents). The States conduct periodic licensing

9 monitoring visits to these facilities, meeting with the staff and children in their care, to ensure

10 that these facilities meet minimum safety standards, including background check approvals,

11 facility safety standards, and ensuring the facilities provide necessary and appropriate care to the
12
children. 13

14

166. For example, in Washington State, any agency that cares for children on a 24-hour

15 basis away from their parents must be licensed. See, e.g. RCW 74.15.020, 74.15.090. Under

16 RCW 74.15.030(7) and .080, the state’s department of social and health services has the

17 authority and duty to access and inspect the facility’s records for the purpose of determining
18 whether or not there is compliance with state licensing requirements. See also ch. 388-145 WAC
19 (the licensing requirements for group homes and youth shelters). These licensing requirements
20 apply to all private facilities, even those operated by a private agency contracting with the federal
21
22 government.

23

167. In the Commonwealth of Massachusetts, no “agency or institution of the federal

24 government” may operate a “[foster care] placement agency, group care facility, or temporary 25 shelter facility” for children unless licensed by the Department of Early Education and Care 26

2 any facility” subject to such licensure. Id, § 9. 3
168. Likewise, New York State has licensing and oversight responsibilities over the 4
facilities where immigrant children who are separated from their parents are placed. Specifically, 5 6 the Bureau of Child Welfare and Community Services (“CWCS”) of the New York State Office
7 of Children and Family Services (“OCFS”) has regulatory, licensing, inspection and supervisory
8 authority over residential programs that care for foster children. N.Y. Soc. Serv. Law §§ 460-b,
9 460-c, 462-a. OCFS issues operating certificates to non-profit agencies in New York State that 10 provide residential care in a congregate setting to UACs, including the children who have been 11
separated from their parents at the border. OCFS, as the licensing state agency of child residential 12
programs in New York, retains the authority to conduct building, equipment, fire and safety 13 14 inspections of these facilities. Also, OCFS has the statutory authority to establish regulatory
15 standards for the certification or approval of foster homes, and the authority of an agency to
16 certify or approve foster homes. N.Y. Soc. Serv. Law §§ 378, 460-a, N.Y. Not-for-Profit Corp.
17 Law § 404(b). Provider agencies in New York that contract with ORR place UACs in foster 18
homes that the agency has approved or certified pursuant to this authority from the state. 19

170. Likewise, Delaware licenses, registers, and monitors all residential and 4
nonresidential childcare facilities including . . . child placement and adoption agencies . . .” 5 6 29 Del. C. § 9003 (7). Delaware’s monitoring scheme includes the right of entrance, inspection,
7 and access to the papers of childcare facilities operating within Delaware and entities that operate

8 within Delaware and place children in other states. 31 Del. C. §§ 343, 344. In certain

9 circumstances, a violation of Delaware’s childcare licensing requirements may constitute a

10 criminal act. 31 Del. C. § 345.
11 171. Other States have similar licensing authority and statutory regimes. These
12 provisions are intended to protect children from substandard housing and care, and are essential
13
14 to the wellbeing of minors placed in facilities located in the States.

15

172. The United States’ Ex Parte Application for relief from the Flores Settlement is

16 a frontal attack on that sovereign interest. That request seeks rescission of Flores’s protections

17 and a “determin[ation] that the Agreement’s state licensure requirement does not apply to ICE
18 family residential facilities.” The United States has thus sought to extinguish state licensing
19 powers over federally contracted out-of-home care providers, leaving those facilities wholly
20 unregulated at the local level. The government’s attempt to modify the Flores settlement terms
21
22 by removing States’ licensing authority and jurisdiction interferes with the States’ sovereign

23 powers.

24

173. Moreover, each of the States is required to respect family integrity absent a

25 finding that a parent is unfit or unavailable to care for a child. Here, the federal government has 26

1 intentionally separated parents from children and is leaving it to the States’ court systems to

2 establish alternative guardianships for them, or relying on state-licensed foster care facilities to
3 care for the children, rendering the States unable to enforce the legal mandates and public
4 policies that require keeping families together unless the best interests of the child dictate
5
6 otherwise.

7

174. For example, the State of Washington has a longstanding public policy affirming

8 the importance of family integrity and the primacy of the parent-child relationship. Wash. Rev.

9 Code § 13.34.020 “declares that the family unit is a fundamental resource of American life which
10 should be nurtured” and mandates “that the family unit should remain intact unless a child’s right 11
to conditions of basic nurture, health, or safety is jeopardized.” Wash. Rev. Code § 26.09.002 12
likewise “recognizes the fundamental importance of the parent-child relationship to the welfare 13
14 of the child” and requires “that the relationship between the child and each parent [] be fostered
15 unless inconsistent with the child’s best interests.” Similarly, Washington’s child abuse and

16 neglect law, contained in chapter 26.44 RCW, enshrines the state’s policy that “[t]he bond

17 between a child and his or her parent . . . is of paramount importance[.]” RCW 26.44.010. Under
18 Washington law, the state is justified to intervene in that relationship only when a child is
19 deprived of the right to conditions of minimal nurture, health, and safety.
20 175. Washington also has recognized that children in government custody have
21
22 substantive due process rights under the U.S. Constitution. See Braam v State of Washington,

23 150 Wn.2d 689, 81 P.3d 851 (2003) (foster children possess substantive due process rights).

24 While these rights are not coextensive with parental rights in every context, Washington 25 recognizes a child’s constitutional rights “to be free from unreasonable risk of harm, including a 26

1 risk flowing from the lack of basic services, and a right to reasonable safety.” Id. The intentional
2 exposure of a child to an unreasonable risk of harm, including physical or mental injury, violates 3
these rights. 4
176. Washington has also declared that practices that discriminate against any of its 5 6 inhabitants because of race, creed, color, or national origin are matters of public concern that
7 threaten the rights and proper privileges of the State and harm the public welfare, health, and

8 peace of the people. See Wash. Rev. Code § 49.60.010.

9

177. The Commonwealth of Massachusetts has long committed itself to the

10 promotion and safeguarding of the family unit. Massachusetts law, for example, notes that “the
11 family is the best source of child rearing,” 110 C.M.R. 1.02, and holds that “the policy of this
12 commonwealth [is] to direct its efforts, first, to the strengthening and encouragement of family
13
14 life for the care and protection of children.” Mass. Gen. Laws c. 119, § 1. Normally, therefore,

15 “the interest of the child is best served by a stable, continuous environment with his or her own

16 family.” Adoption of Frederick, 405 Mass. 1, 4 (1989). As a result, the Commonwealth allows

17 “state intervention into a family unit [to] be used only when it is clearly needed to protect a
18 child.” 110 C.M.R. 1.02.
19 178. The Commonwealth of Massachusetts has also long protected the civil rights and
20 liberties of its residents, outlawing practices that harm or discriminate individuals based on race,
21
22 color, religious creed, or national origin. See, e.g., Mass. Gen. Laws c. 151B, § 4; c. 151C, § 2;

23 c. 76, § 5; and c. 272, § 98.

25 concerns that are grossly undermined by defendants’ unlawful actions, thus harming Oregon’s 26

1 sovereign interests. Oregon recognizes the intrinsic value of family relationships and prioritizes
2 protecting them. For example, Or. Rev. Stat. § 419B.007 states the policy of Oregon is to 3
“preserve family life” by “stabilizing the family.” In addition, Oregon has declared there is a 4
“strong preference” that children live “with their own families.” Or. Rev. Stat. § 419B.090(5). 5 6 Similarly, custody determinations are based on the best interest of the child, including “[t]he
7 emotional ties between the child and other family members” as well as “[t]he desirability of
8 continuing an existing relationship.” Id. Oregon thus places great value on the parent-child
9 relationship, on “interaction, companionship, interplay and mutuality, that fulfilled the child’s
10 psychological needs for a parent” in addition to a child’s physical needs. Or. Rev. Stat. § 109.119 11
(10)(a). 12
180. Oregon further recognizes that children are individuals who have legal rights. 13 14 Among those rights are “freedom from…emotional abuse or exploitation.” Or. Rev. Stat. §
15 419B.090(1). To that end, Oregon has enacted laws and policies to protect children’s rights. For
16 example, “[i]t is the policy of the State of Oregon to safeguard and promote each child’s right to
17 safety, stability and well-being and to safeguard and promote each child’s relationships with 18
parents, siblings, grandparents, other relatives and adults with whom a child develops healthy 19
emotional attachments.” Or. Rev. Stat. § 419B.090(3). 20
181. Moreover, Oregon acknowledges the importance of due process rights afforded 21 22 to parents facing “interference” with their right to “direct the upbringing of their children”
23 because the policy of Oregon is to “guard the liberty interest of parents protected by the
24 Fourteenth Amendment to the United States Constitution and to protect the rights and interests
25 of children.” Or. Rev. Stat. § 419B.090(4). Oregon requires appointment of legal counsel for 26

1 parents whenever due process so requires, and courts must consider “[t]he duration of and degree
2 of invasiveness of the interference with the parent-child relationship” that could result from legal 3
proceedings as well as the “effects” the proceedings may have on later proceedings or events 4
that may interfere with the parent-child relationship. Or. Rev. Stat. § 419B.205(1). Pursuant to 5 6 Or. Rev. Stat. § 419B.165, a child taken into custody must be released to a parent unless a court
7 order prevents it or there is probable cause to believe the child may be endangered by immediate

8 release.

9

182. When parents and children are separated, Oregon prioritizes a child’s existing

10 relationships in considering placement alternatives. For example, “there shall be a preference
11 given to placement of the child or ward with relatives and persons who have a caregiver
12 relationship with the child.” Or. Rev. Stat. § 419B.192(1). Oregon law also recognizes the value
13
14 of sibling relationships and requires state social agencies to make “diligent efforts” to keep

15 siblings together when they have been separated from their parents. Or. Rev. Stat. §

16 419B.192(2).

17

183. Children separated from families in Oregon are entitled to participate in age and

18 developmentally appropriate activities. Specifically, this includes activities that are reflective
19 of and promote “development of cognitive, emotional, physical and behavioral capacities that
20
are typical for an age or age group.” Or. Rev. Stat. § 419B.194(a)(A). Moreover, Oregon 21

22 requires appropriate activities for a specific child separated from family “based on the

23 developmental stages attained by the child.” Or. Rev. Stat. § 419B.194(a)(B). In making these

24 determinations, the “reasonable and prudent parent standard” applies. Or. Rev. Stat. § 25 419B.194(b). The standard is characterized by “careful and sensible parental decisions that 26

1 maintain the health, safety and best interests of a child or ward while encouraging the emotional
2 and developmental growth of the child or ward…” Id. 3
184. Oregon has also codified anti-discrimination policies that protect all Oregon 4
residents from disparate treatment based on race, color, religion, sex, sexual orientation, national 5 6 origin, marital status or age. Or. Rev. Stat. § 659A.403(1). Further, it is unlawful for any person
7 to deny another full and equal accommodations, advantages, facilities, and privileges of any

8 place of public accommodation. Or. Rev. Stat. § 659A.403(3).

9

185. The State of California similarly has a long history of preserving the integrity of

10 the family unit and the parent-child relationship. For example, California Welfare and
11 Institutions Code section 11205 declares “the family unit is of fundamental importance to society
12 in nurturing its members,” and states “[e]ach family has the right and responsibility to provide
13
14 sufficient support and protection of its children.” California’s policy to “preserve and strengthen

15 a child’s family ties whenever possible” and to remove a child from the custody of his or her

16 parents “only when necessary for his or her welfare or for the safety and protection of the public”

17 is delineated in California Welfare and Institution Code section 201, subdivision (a), and section
18 16000, subdivision (a).
19 186. California’s interests in protecting the physical, emotional and psychological
20 health of minors and in preserving and fostering the parent-child relationship “are extremely
21
22 important interests that rise to the level of ‘compelling interests’ for purposes of constitutional

23 analysis.” American Academy of Pediatrics v. Lungren, 16 Cal. 4th 307, 348 (1997).

187. It is California policy that social services programs must prevent or reduce

2 inappropriate institutional care by providing community-based care, home-based care, or other
3 forms of less intensive care. Cal. Welf. & Inst. Code § 13003(4).
4 188. In California, per statute, any out-of-home placement of children must be in the
5
6 “least restrictive family setting,” and should promote “normal childhood experiences that [are]

7 suited to meet the child's or youth's individual needs.” Cal. Welf. & Inst. Code § 16000(a).

8

189. California also has robust constitutional and statutory protections against

9 discrimination. For example, the California Constitution protects against discrimination on the
10 basis of race, creed, color or national or ethnic origin. Cal. Const. art. I, § 8. California law also 11
protects against discrimination on the basis of ancestry, citizenship, primary language, and 12
immigration status. Cal. Civ. Code § 51. California is also committed to developing strategic 13
14 polices and plans regarding health issues affecting immigrants and refugees. Cal. Health & Saf.
15 Code § 131019.5.

16

190. The State of New Mexico’s laws embody a public policy dedicated to the

17 preservation of the family unit. NMSA 1978, Sec. 32A-1-3 (2009). To “the maximum extent
18 possible, children in New Mexico shall be reared as members of a family unit.” Id. See also
19 NMSA 1978, Section 40-15-3 (2005) (“It is the policy of the state that its laws and programs
20 shall: support intact, functional families and promote each family's ability and responsibility to

23 can remain safely in their own homes when their homes are safe environments and in their

1 support for the family” as a “institution” and that the Act is “intended to serve as a benchmark

2 against which other legislation may be measured to assess whether it furthers the goals of
3 preserving and enhancing families in New Mexico.” NMSA 1978, Section 40-15-2 (2005). New
4 Mexico case law affirms there is a clearly established right to familial integrity embodied in the
5
6 Fourteenth Amendment. Oldfield v. Benavidez, 1994-NMSC-006, ¶ 14, 116 N.M. 785.

7

191. The New Mexico Children’s Code also ensures that New Mexican parents have

8 substantial due process protections prior to losing the right to care of and custody of their own

9 children. See NMSA 1978, Section 32A-4-28. The sole fact that a parent is incarcerated is not
10 a basis for terminating parental rights. Id. A parent's fundamental liberty interest in the care, 11
custody, and management of their children is well established. See State ex rel. Children, Youth 12
& Families Dep't v. Mafin M., 2003–NMSC–015, ¶ 18, 133 N.M. 827, 70 P.3d 1266; State ex 13

192. New Mexico custody determinations are also driven by the best interests of the

2 child. See Schuermann v. Schuermann, 1980-NMSC-027, ¶ 6, 94 N.M. 81 (“In any proceeding
3 involving custody, the courts' primary concern and consideration must be for the child's best
4 interests.”) (citing NMSA 1978, Section 40-4-9(A) (1977)). “In any case in which a judgment
5
6 or decree will be entered awarding the custody of a minor, the district court shall, if the minor is

7 under the age of fourteen, determine custody in accordance with the best interests of the child.”

8 Id.

9

193. The laws of the State of New Mexico dictate that the best interests of a child, if

10 not properly within the custody of their parents, then lies in the custody of other family members.
11 This policy is not only rooted in the best interests of children generally, but is designed to protect
12 both family unity as well as unique cultural heritage. Under the State’s Kinship Guardianship
13
14 Act, family members have a protected interest in raising a child when neither parent is available.

15 NMSA 1978, Section 40-10B-2 (2001). Where the United States’ policy of family separation

16 does not provide a meaningful opportunity for children who are separated from their parents to

17 unite with other members of their family, it is direct contravention of the laws of this state and
18 the policy principles that underlying those laws. Further, because “a kinship guardian possesses
19 the same legal rights and responsibilities of a biological parent,” members of separated children’s
20 families should be afforded the opportunity to seek custody of their relatives. State ex rel.
21
22 Children, Youth & Families Dep’t v. Djamila B., 2015-NMSC-003. To reiterate, any policy or

23 practice of the federal government that would serve to deny or otherwise disrupt any family

24 member’s ability to take custody of their child relative is an affront to the laws of a sovereign 25 state and the views of the people therein. 26

194. New Mexico’s Children’s Code is structured to promote child safety, recognize

2 cultural diversity, and to ensure that civil and criminal justice systems are coordinated. NMSA
3 1978, Section 32A-1-3 (2009). All children are to be provided services sensitive to their cultural
4 needs. Id.; see also NMSA 1978, Section 32A-18-1 (2009) (requiring cross-cultural training
5
6 for all caregivers and service-providers under the children’s code). Families seeking asylum do

7 not face allegations of abuse, neglect, or a crime that allows children to be removed from the

8 custody of their parents under New Mexico law. In New Mexico, the mental and physical

9 wellbeing of children is paramount. NMSA 1978, Section 32A-1-3(A)(2009). Children removed
10 from the home in New Mexico because of a parent’s criminal behavior are afforded due process 11
and representation of counsel in every proceeding other than probation. State v. Doe, 197712
NMCA-234, 91 N.M. 232, 572 P.2d 960,cert. denied 91 N.M. 249, 572 P.2d 1257 (1978). See 13

16 protect the interests of a minor may constitute a denial of due process, thereby invalidating such

17 proceedings.”
18 195. The State of New Jersey has a longstanding public policy confirming the
19 importance of family integrity and the primacy of the parent-child relationship. New Jersey law
20 declares that “the preservation and strengthening of family life is a matter of public concern as
21
22 being in the interest of the general welfare.” N.J. Stat. Ann. § 30:4C-1(a). It also includes a

23 mandate “to make reasonable efforts … to preserve the family in order to prevent the need for

24 removing the child” from his or her parents, and to return the child safely to his or her parents if 25 possible. N.J. Stat. Ann. § 30:4C-11.1. In determining whether removal of a child is required, 26

1 “the health and safety of the child shall be of paramount concern to the court.” N.J. Stat. Ann.

2 § 30:4C-11.2. Moreover, any proceeding which may result in even a temporary loss of custody

3 of a child implicates a parent’s state constitutional right to appointed counsel. In re
4 Guardianship of Dotson, 72 N.J. 112, 123 (1976).

6

196. New Jersey has also long protected the civil rights and civil liberties of its

7 residents, including by prohibiting discrimination on the basis of race, creed, color, or national

8 origin. See, e.g., N.J. Stat. Ann. § 10:5-12.

9

197. The State of Rhode Island has a longstanding public policy affirming the

10 importance of family integrity and the primacy of the parent-child relationship. For example,
11 R.I. Gen. Law § 42-72-2 (1979) declares that “the state has a basic obligation to promote,
12 safeguard and protect the social well-being and development of the children of the state through
13
14 a comprehensive program providing for” such items as “the strengthening of the family unit”

15 and “making the home safe for children by enhancing the parental capacity for good child care

16 and services to children and their families to prevent the unnecessary removal of children from

17 their homes”. See R.I. Gen. Laws § 42-72-2 (1979).
18 198. Rhode Island has declared that practices that discriminate against any of its
19 persons within the state on the basis of race, color, religion, sex, disability, age, or country of
20 ancestral origin are matters of public concern that threaten the rights and proper privileges of the
21
22 State and harm the public welfare, health, and peace of the people. See. R.I. Gen. Laws § 42-

23 112-1 (1990).

1 “without proper parental care or subsistence, education, medical, or other care necessary for
2 [their] well-being.” 33 V.S.A. § 5102(3)(B). That duty includes bearing “such expenses for the 3
proper care, maintenance, and education of a child, including the expenses of medical, surgical, 4
or psychiatric examination or treatment” as deemed necessary in connection with juvenile care 5 6 proceedings. 33 V.S.A. § 5116(a). Vermont authorities owe a corollary duty “to preserve the
7 family and to separate a child from his or her parents only when necessary to protect the child

8 from serious harm or in the interests of public safety.” 33 V.S.A. § 5101(a)(3).

9

200. Where children require foster care, Vermont strives to ensure their placement in

10 a healthy, loving environment through strict licensing requirements. See 33 V.S.A. § 4905; Vt.
11 Admin. Code § 12-3-501. The Vermont Department of Children and Families closely regulates
12 not only the child’s physical environment but also the individuals who may be entrusted to care
13
14 for the child. See Vt. Admin. Code §§ 12-3-501:20; 12-3-501:40.

15

201. Vermont has long protected its residents from discrimination on the basis of race,

16 color, and national origin — irrespective of their citizenship status. See, e.g., 9 V.S.A. §§ 4502-

17 4503 (public accommodations and housing); 21 V.S.A § 495 (employment); and 13 V.S.A. §
18 1455 (bias-motivated crimes). Vermont continues to reaffirm this commitment through
19 legislation. See, e.g., Vermont Act. 5 (S. 79) (March 28, 2017) (“In Vermont, we celebrate the
20 rich cultural heritage and diversity of our residents. . . . All Vermont residents should be free
21
22 from discrimination on the basis of their sex, sexual orientation, gender identity, marital status,

23 race, color, religion, national origin, immigration status, age, or disability.”).

202. The State of Minnesota’s public policy also affirms the importance of family

25 integrity. For example, Minnesota Statutes section 252.32 declares that it is the State’s policy 26

1 “that all children are entitled to live in families that offer safe, nurturing, permanent relationships,

2 and that public services be directed toward preventing the unnecessary separation of children
3 from their families.” Minn. Stat. § 252.32, subd. 1. In addition, Minnesota Statutes section
4 260C.001 recognizes the importance of “preserv[ing] and strengthen[ing] the child’s family ties
5
6 whenever possible and in the child’s best interests . . . .” Minn. Stat. § 260C.001, subd. 1(b)(3).

7

203. Minnesota has also declared that the State’s public policy is that persons be free

8 from discrimination in employment, housing and real property, public accommodations, public

9 services, and education on the basis of, among other things, race, color, creed, or national origin.

10 Minn. Stat. § 363A.02, subd. 1(a). “Such discrimination threatens the rights and privileges of

11 the inhabitants of this state and menaces the institutions and foundations of democracy.” Id.
12
subd. 1(b). 13

14

204. The State of Iowa has a longstanding policy that favors the protection of the

15 family unit. The State of Iowa only separates parents and children in the most exceptional of

16 circumstances because when we do so we “inflict[] a unique deprivation of a constitutionally

17 protected liberty interest[.]”In re M.S., 889 N.W.2d 675, 677-78 (Iowa Ct. App. 2016). “An
18 innocent man can be set free. The landowner can be justly compensated. The childless parent
19 has no recourse.” Id. To that end, Iowa’s child welfare system strives to ensure that every child
20 receives the care, guidance, and control she needs in her own home, with her own parents,
21
22 whenever possible. Iowa Code § 232.1. “[T]he custody, care, and nurture of the child reside

23 first in the parents” and it is presumed to be in a child’s best interest to remain in parental custody.

24 In re M.S., 889 N.W.2d 675, 677-78 (Iowa Ct. App. 2016); In re N.M., 528 N.W.2d 94, 96 (Iowa 25 1995). Under Iowa law, a family cannot be broken up simply upon proof that a parent has 26

205. The State of Iowa prohibits discrimination based on race, creed, color, national

7 origin, or religion. See Iowa Code chapter 216.

8

206. The State of Illinois has a longstanding policy recognizing the importance of

9 maintaining the family relationship.

10

207. The Illinois Juvenile Court Act of 1987, for example, declares that the State

11 should “secure for each minor subject hereto such care and guidance, preferably in his or her
12
own home, as will serve the safety and moral, emotional, mental, and physical welfare of the 13

14 minor and the best interests of the community; [and] preserve and strengthen the minor’s family

15 ties whenever possible, removing him or her from the custody of his or her parents only when

16 his or her safety or welfare or the protection of the public cannot be adequately safeguarded

17 without removal.” 705 ILCS 405/1-2.
18 208. The Illinois Abused and Neglected Child Reporting Act likewise instructs the
19 Department of Children and Family Services to “protect the health, safety, and best interests of
20 the child in all situations in which the child is vulnerable to child abuse or neglect, offer
21
22 protective services in order to prevent any further harm to the child and to other children in the

23 same environment or family, stabilize the home environment, and preserve family life whenever

24 possible.” 325 ILCS 5/2(a). 25

209. In addition, the State of Illinois has a longstanding policy affirming the

2 importance of assisting the state’s immigrant population.
3 210. The Illinois Attorney General Act declares that “[i]t is imperative that State
4 government is aware of the needs of the State’s immigrant community and sensitive to the
5
6 barriers that may prevent them from seeking and obtaining services.” 15 ILCS 205/6.6(a). The

7 Act further directs the Office of the Illinois Attorney General to “assist immigrants by increasing

8 accessibility to the Office and providing outreach services to the community, which will serve

9 to educate immigrants as to their rights and responsibilities as residents of the State.” Id.

10

211. New York State has a strong interest in family unity. It is the long-established

11 policy and practice of the State to prioritize keeping a child with his or her parent or parents.
12
OCFS operates under the principal that families staying together is the most desired outcome for 13

14 children. Children are some of the most vulnerable residents in New York State and they best

15 develop their unique potential in a caring and healthy family environment with their birth parents

16 or other relatives. The State’s first obligation is to help the family with services to prevent its

17 break-up, or to quickly reunite the family if the child has already been separated from his parents.

18 That is because the child’s need for a normal family life will usually best be met with his or her
19 birth parent, and parents are entitled to bring up their own children unless the best interests of
20
the child would thereby be endangered. N.Y. Soc. Serv. Law § 384-b(1); N.Y. Exec. Law § 990. 21

22

212. New York State has a strong interest in promulgating and operating under non-

23 discriminatory policies. In fact, the legislature has declared that non-discrimination is a guiding

24 principal of policy in New York State. New York’s legislature has found that “the state has the 25 responsibility to act to assure that every individual within this state is afforded an equal 26

1 opportunity to enjoy a full and productive life and that the failure to provide such equal
2 opportunity, whether because of discrimination, prejudice, intolerance or inadequate education, 3
training, housing or health care not only threatens the rights and proper privileges of its 4
inhabitants but menaces the institutions and foundation of a free democratic state and threatens 5 6 the peace, order, health, safety and general welfare of the state and its inhabitants.” N.Y. Exec.
7 Law § 290. Thus, it is unlawful to discriminate against any person in New York State on the
8 basis of age, race, creed, color, national origin, sexual orientation, military status, sex, disability,
9 predisposing genetic characteristics, familial status, marital status, domestic violence victim
10 status, gender identity, transgender status, and gender dysphoria. N.Y. Exec. Law § 296; 9 N.Y. 11
Comp. Codes R. & Regs. Tit. 9 § 466.13(c)(2)-(3). 12
213. This principal of non-discrimination is also applied at the agency level. For 13 14 example, OCFS promulgates regulatory standards that expressly prohibit discrimination or
15 harassment of adults or children involved in child welfare programs and services based on race,
16 creed, color, national origin, age, sex, religion, sexual orientation, gender identity or expression,
17 marital status or disability. N.Y. Comp. Codes R. & Regs. Tit. 10 §§ 421.6, 423.4, 441.24 18
214. The State of Maryland has longstanding policies affirming the importance of 19
family integrity and of protecting the wellbeing of children to the greatest extent 20
possible. Maryland’s Legislature has declared that “it is the policy of this State to promote 21 22 family stability, [and] to preserve family unity[.]” Md. Code Ann., Fam. Law § 4-
23 401(1). Maryland’s statute governing custody proceedings for children in need of assistance is
24 intended to “conserve and strengthen the child’s family ties and to separate a child from the
25 child’s parents only when necessary for the child’s welfare,” and to “provide for the care, 26

215. Maryland also has a public policy prohibiting discrimination against any of its

7 inhabitants because of their race, age, color, creed, or national origin, and has enacted anti-

8 discrimination laws in a wide array of contexts, ranging from public accommodations, see Md.

9 Code Ann., State Gov’t §§ 20-304, to employment, id. § 20-602, to residential housing, id. § 20-

10 702. Maryland law also prohibits any person from retaliating against any person because he or

11 she has exercised or enjoyed the rights granted or protected by Maryland’s anti-discrimination
12
laws, id. § 20-708(2). 13

14

216. It is the policy of the State of Maryland, “in the exercise of its police power for

15 the protection of the public safety, public health, and general welfare, for the maintenance of

16 business and good government, and for the promotion of the State’s trade, commerce, and

17 manufacturers,” to “assure all people equal opportunity in receiving employment” regardless of
18 race, color, religion, age, ancestry, or national origin. Md. Code Ann., State Gov’t § 20-602.
19 217. The Commonwealth of Pennsylvania has a longstanding public policy
20 recognizing the significance of family integrity and the parent-child relationship. For example,
21
22 Pennsylvania law declares that “[t]he family is the basic institution in society in which our

23 children’s sense of self-esteem and positive self-image are developed and nurtured” and that

24 “[t]hese feelings and values are essential to a healthy, productive and independent life during 25 adulthood.” 62 P.S. § 2172(a)(1). Similarly, Pennsylvania’s Domestic Relations Act states that 26

1 “[t]he family is the basic unit in society and the protection and preservation of the family is of
2 paramount public concern.” 23 Pa.C.S. § 3102(a). 3
218. Pennsylvania law further recognizes that children who are separated from their 4
parents are deprived “of the unique bond which exists in the parent-child relationship, leaving 5 6 emotional scars on such children which may never fully heal” because “children are better off
7 emotionally when their needs can be met by their biological parents.” 62 P.S. § 2172(a). This
8 reality is recognized throughout Pennsylvania law. For instance, the Commonwealth’s Juvenile
9 Act seeks to “preserve the unity of the family whenever possible” and to separate “the child
10 from parents only when necessary for his welfare, safety or health or in the interests of public 11
safety.” 42 Pa.C.S. § 6301(b). 12
219. To separate a child from her family is among the most intrusive acts that the 13 14 government can initiate. North Carolina has long committed itself to separating families only as
15 a last resort, and only after exhausting other options, and taking all appropriate measures to
16 ensure the safety of children. In North Carolina, protection of the family unit is guaranteed not
17 only by the U.S. Constitution but also by North Carolina law. Adams v. Tessner, 354 N.C. 57, 18
60 (N.C. 2001). As a result, taking a child away from its parent requires “a showing that the 19
parent is unfit to have custody.” Id. at 62. 20
220. Parents of children in North Carolina have due process rights that require 21 22 “reasonable efforts [to be] made to prevent or eliminate the need for removal of the child” from
23 her parents, but only to allow removal when “necessary to protect the safety and health of the
24 child.” In re Dula, 143 N.C. App. 16, 17 (N.C. Ct. App. 2001). A parent’s “right to retain
25 custody of their child and to determine the care and supervision suitable for their child is a 26

2 N.C. 101, 106 (N.C. 1984). 3
221. The people of North Carolina, in their Declaration of Rights, have stated that 4
“[n]o person . . . shall be subjected to discrimination by the State because of race, color, religion, 5 6 or national origin.” N.C. Const. Art. I, § 19. The State of North Carolina reiterates this
7 commitment in numerous statutes that make it unlawful to discriminate on the basis of, inter

8 alia, race, color, religion, or national origin. See, e.g., N.C. Gen. Stat. §§ 75B-2, 41A-4, 95-151,

9 126-16, 143-422.2.

10

222. In the State of Delaware, “parents have the primary responsibility for meeting

11 the needs of their children and the State has an obligation to help them discharge this
12
responsibility . . .” 29 Del. C. § 9001. Delaware law explicitly declares that “the State has a 13

14 basic obligation to promote family stability and preserve the family as a unit….” Id. Delaware

15 law also recognizes that preservation of the family as a unit is “fundamental to the maintenance

16 of a stable, democratic society.” 10 Del. C. § 902(a). To that end, the state has directed its

17 courts, when possible consistent with the safety of family members, to ensure that homes

18 “remain unbroken.” Id. The express statutory child welfare policy of the State is to “serve to
19 advance the interests and secure the safety of the child, while preserving the family unit
20
whenever the safety of the child is not jeopardized.” 16 Del. C. § 901. 21

22

223. The State of Delaware has comprehensively prohibited discrimination based on

23 race and national origin in its laws, including the areas of public accommodations (6 Del. C. §

24 4501, housing (6 Del. C. § 4601), and employment (19 Del. C. § 711). While children forcibly 25 separated from their parents pursuant to the Trump Administration’s policy are not presently 26

7 to the need to provide care for children who have been psychologically traumatized by

8 involuntary separation from their parents. In order to ensure a complete injunction, to eliminate

9 the chilling effect on the exercise of the fundamental rights of documented and undocumented

10 immigrants presently residing in the State of Delaware, to protect the sovereignty of the State of
11 Delaware by protecting its obligation to assist parents in meeting the needs of children, and to
12 maintain the appropriate licensure and supervision of childcare facilities within the State,
13
14 Delaware joins this action.

224. The District of Columbia is uniquely situated among the Plaintiff States, as it

16 has no sovereign interest to claim as against the Federal Government. See Const. art. I, § 8, cl.

18 Columbia ex rel. Am. Combustion, Inc. v. Transamerica Ins. Co., 797 F.2d 1041, 1046 (D.C.

20 its quasi-sovereign interests and its authority to enforce its laws and uphold the public interest
21
22 under its Attorney General Act, which was intended to incorporate the common law authority of

23 states’ attorneys general. D.C. Code. § 1-301.81. See also Alfred L. Snapp & Son, Inc. v. Puerto

24 Rico ex rel. Barez, 458 U.S. 592, 608 n.15 (1982) (recognizing that Puerto Rico “has a claim to 25 represent its quasi-sovereign interests in federal court at least as strong as that of any State”). 26

1 K. Defendants’ Policy Harms the States’ Proprietary Interests

2

225. The Policy also harms the States’ proprietary interests. ORR places thousands of

3 unaccompanied minors with sponsors (adults who can care for the child during the pendency of
4 immigration proceedings) in the States every year. In FY 2016, ORR placed 52,147 individual
5

6 children in such placements nationwide. In FY 2017, there were 42,497 placements, and so far

7 there have been almost 20,000 in FY 2018 (October-April). See Unaccompanied Alien Children

8 Released to Sponsors by State (June 30, 2017) available at

9 https://www.acf.hhs.gov/orr/resource/unaccompanied-alien-children-released-to-sponsors-by-
10 state, attached hereto as Ex 88. These ORR data are inclusive of children who were separated 11
as a result of the Policy. 12
226. The States are receiving and will continue to receive an increasing number of 13
14 separated immigrant parents and children if Defendants are allowed to continue implementing
15 their Policy. The federal government’s separation of these families and transfer of separated

16 persons into the States places increased burdens on state resources, particularly because of the

17 acute trauma that children and parents have experienced due to Defendants’ unlawful policy.
18 Children who have been separated from their parents and are awaiting immigration proceedings
19 (for example the adjudication of an asylum application or adjustment of status) are entitled to
20 access a variety of state-funded programs. Providing the necessary services to address the legal,
21
22 educational, physical, and psychological needs of parents and children who have been separated

23 will burden the state systems. The following are non-exclusive examples of state systems that

24 are impacted. 25

227. Courts. Many of the sponsors of these children will need to obtain guardianship

2 through the States’ juvenile and family courts. This is not discretionary: ORR’s agreement with
3 sponsors requires “best efforts” to establish such guardianships, and sponsors in many states
4 would be unable to access medical and educational records and make important decisions for the
5
6 children in their care without such court-ordered guardianships. See Sponsor Care Agreement

9 and attached hereto as Ex. 89.

10

228. Children who have been separated from their parents will also access the State

11 courts to obtain orders necessary for their immigration proceedings. For example, some such
12
children are eligible for Special Immigrant Juvenile Status (SIJS), pursuant to federal law. See 13

14 Immigration and Nationality Act (INA) §203(b)(4); INA §101(a)(27)(j); Trafficking Victims

15 Protection Reauthorization Act of 2008 (TVPRA), P.L. 110-457 §235. In these proceedings, the

16 federal immigration system relies on the expertise of state courts in making determinations

17 regarding a child’s welfare, requiring SIJS-eligible children to seek SIJS predicate findings from
18 a state’s juvenile court.
19 229. Education. Public elementary and secondary schools have a constitutional
20 obligation to educate students irrespective of immigration status. See Plyler v. Doe, 457 U.S.
21
22 202 (1982), and various statutory obligations to provide particularized services to high needs

23 students, such as through the Individuals with Disabilities Education Act (IDEA). Children

24 separated from their parents and placed with sponsors will attend the States’ public schools and 25 receive a variety of educational services, including special education, ESL programs, mental 26

1 health services, and other programs delivered within the school district. Such programs are
2 funded in large part through local levy funds and state dollars. Indeed, state funding for general 3
education delivered in public schools is calculated in part on a per-student basis. 4
230. The trauma of forcible separation from a parent renders public schooling more 5 6 difficult and expensive for the States to provide. Research shows that the experience of trauma
7 may severely undercut a child’s ability to learn and function in the classroom. See Helping

8 Traumatized Children Learn, available at https://traumasensitiveschools.org/wp-

9 content/uploads/2013/06/Helping-Traumatized-Children-Learn.pdf, attached hereto as Ex. 90.
10 Children may require additional mental health services through school guidance counselors and 11
social workers; they may have behavioral problems and trauma-related learning disabilities that 12
would need to be addressed; and they lack the critically important educational advocacy and 13
14 partnership that parents can provide. Students without parents to care for them are also more
15 likely to arrive at school with housing and food insecurity and require additional attention and

16 resources to address hunger, exhaustion, and increased levels of stress and anxiety.

17

231. Healthcare. Such children are also often eligible for State-funded healthcare

18 programs, including mental health care treatment. Health care costs will be exacerbated for the
19 states because of the Policy, as children who suffer prolonged and unexpected separation from
20
their parents experience particular health effects, including higher levels of anxiety, more 21

22 susceptibility to physical and emotional illness, and decreased capacity to manage their

23 emotions. These health effects may result in higher levels of care and increase costs to the state.

specifically directed at helping immigrants and refugees, as well as programs designed to address 5 6 the consequences of trauma. Some have limited available group care facilities that they stand to
7 lose to ORR placements because of the increase in separated families.

8

233. The plaintiff States are already experiencing some of these proprietary harms.

9

234. Washington. For example, ORR places hundreds of unaccompanied minors with

10 sponsors in the state of Washington every year. For FY 2017, the last year for which complete

11 data are available, ORR placed almost 500 children with Washington resident sponsors. As of
12
April 30, 2018, ORR’s available data show that Washington has already received 278 13

235. Washington has almost 300 public school districts and serves well over a million

18 children. Per pupil expenditures for 2016-17, for example, were more than $11,800 per

236. Washington State children residing in households with an income less than 312

2 percent of the federal poverty level are eligible for the Apple Health program, regardless of
3 citizenship and/or documented status. Qualifying children receive access to the full scope of
4 health care coverage including medical, dental, behavioral health, vison, hearing and
5
6 pharmaceutical benefits. Of the $7.3 billion that Washington state spent in state fiscal year 2017

7 to support the entire Apple Health program, the cost to cover minor children was $1.6 billion. In

8 state fiscal year 2017, the cost to cover undocumented immigrant children was $31 million. The

9 average cost per undocumented child in state fiscal year 2017 was $1,552 per year.

10

237. Washington’s Office of Refugee and Immigrant Assistance (ORIA) is part of the

11 State of Washington, Department of Social and Health Services (DSHS). ORIA coordinates and
12
facilitates the provision of services for people who are refugees and immigrants to enable them to 13

14 achieve economic stability and integrate into Washington communities. To do this, ORIA braids

15 federal funding from the ORR with other federal and state dollars, for a total annual budget of

16 $27,925,874. This funding provides services to more than 10,000 refugees and immigrants each

17 year through contracts with more than 60 different organizations across the state to offer 11 distinct
18 programs and services. National immigration policies affect the state’s access to federal funding.
19 For example, around August of 2014, the nation experienced an influx of unaccompanied
20 immigrant children being apprehended by immigration officials, and ORR reduced
21
22 Washington’s federal funding to provide refugee social services to cover an increase in costs at

23 the national level.

the Policy may suffer from such disturbances. 4
244. Oregon. Defendants’ Policy also harms Oregon’s proprietary interests, because 5 6 it forces Oregon to expend resources and incur costs that would otherwise not be required. For
7 example, unaccompanied minors detained in Oregon have often suffered severe trauma in their

8 home countries. Children separated from their parents under this Policy have suffered additional

9 trauma from Defendants’ actions. Counsel for these minors can and do file petitions with the
10 juvenile court departments of the Oregon Circuit Courts on their behalf to obtain Special 11
Immigrant Juvenile status. This allows the court to transfer custody to the Oregon Department 12
of Human Services, where they can be placed in foster care and receive other necessary services, 13
14 such as healthcare, education, and other support. This process employs the financial and other
15 resources of the state of Oregon.

16

245. Children in Oregon, including those separated from parents, are entitled to a

17 public education. The cost of that education as of 2016-17 was $11,715 per student, with 92%
18 from state and local resources.
19 246. Children in Oregon, including those separated from parents, may be eligible for
20 health care funded in part by the state of Oregon. Children separated from parents who may
21
22 become wards of the state due to forced separation would become eligible for state-funded

23 healthcare at a cost of approximately $664 per-member per-month. Federal reimbursement is

7 California resident sponsors. As of April 30, 2018, California has already received 2,807

8 unaccompanied children during this fiscal year. See Ex. 88.

9

248. In California, any child, including children who have been separated from their

10 parents, is entitled to a free public education. Per pupil expenditures in 2017-18 exceeded
11 $14,000 per child from all fund sources. Of this total, over 91% came from state and local
12 resources. California has also dedicated educational funds to meeting the needs of
13
14 unaccompanied immigrant children.

15

249. In California, undocumented children receive healthcare coverage paid for

16 entirely by the State. See Cal. Welf. & Inst. Code § 14007.8. These children are also eligible

17 for and benefit from other state funded public health programs.
18 250. Children separated from their parents because of the Policy may require
19 determinations by California courts in order to obtain a guardianship or a predicate order
20 enabling the child to apply for Special Immigrant Juvenile Status. See Cal. Prob. Code § 1514;

252. California’s Refugee Programs Bureau is part of the Immigration and Refugee

10 Programs Branch of the California Department of Social Services (CDSS). This Bureau
11 provides assistance to newly arrived refugees to support long term social and economic
12 integration. In FY 2017, at least 12,058 refugees arrived in the state of California, and received
13
14 assistance from the State in the form of nutrition aid, cash assistance, employment services,

15 immigration legal services, medical services, and educational support. The Bureau administers

16 the Unaccompanied Refugee Minors (URM) Program, the Refugee School Impact Grant (RSIG),

17 and the California Newcomer Education and Well-Being (CalNEW), three programs exclusively
18 for minors. The URM provides foster care, case management, mental health, and medical
19 services to certain unaccompanied minors. Through RSIG and CalNEW, the RPB funds
20 programs in schools to provide supplementary educational and social adjustment support
21
22 services including academic, English-language acquisition, and mental and well-being supports.

23 The CalNEW is funded exclusively by the State. Combined, these programs help ensure that

24 immigrants coming to California are prepared to be full participants in California society and 25 culture, and that they are able to thrive in their new surroundings. 26

260. The Policy’s negative impact upon immigrants also threatens Vermont’s

2 economic interests. For example, in 2014, immigrant households paid $57.9 million in state and
3 local taxes. Of that amount, undocumented immigrants paid an estimated $2.9 million in state
4 and local taxes that year. Immigrants also greatly contributed to the economy with over $462.5
5
6 million in spending power. See The Contributions of New Americans in Vermont, New

261. Minnesota. For FY 2017, the last year for which complete data are available, 13
14 ORR placed over 300 children with Minnesota resident sponsors. As of April 30, 2018, ORR’s
15 available data show that Minnesota has already received 164 unaccompanied children during

16 this fiscal year. See Ex. 88.

262. In Minnesota, any child, including children who have been separated from their

18 parents, is eligible to a free public education. On average, per pupil expenditures for the current
19 fiscal year is $12,251 per child. Of this total, approximately 96% comes from state and local
20
resources. If, as may be expected, an immigrant child requires services through the English 21

22 Learners program, the state funds an additional $700 or $950 per child. Children in Minnesota

23 may also require special education, mental health services, and other programs delivered within

24 the school district. Unaccompanied children, including those who are separated from their 25 parents, may also receive child care assistance in certain settings. 26

265. Iowa. Likewise, since 2014, ORR has placed 980 unaccompanied children with

10 sponsors in Iowa. See Ex. 93.

(DCFS) exists the Office of the DCFS Guardian. This Guardian serves as the legal parent of 13
14 every child in the custody of DCFS, “monitor[ing] and mak[ing] critical decisions based on the

15 child’s best interests regarding major medical treatment, … and all other decisions requiring

272. For example, every child residing in Illinois, including children who have been

2 separated from their parents, is entitled to a free public education. In school year 2015–16,
3 Illinois per-pupil expenditures exceed $12,900 per child. Of this total, over 92% comes from

273. Moreover, separated children enrolled in Illinois schools may receive bilingual

9 support services through Transitional Bilingual Education (TBE) Programs and/or Transitional
10 Programs of Instruction (TPI). These programs help English Learners achieve academically, 11
and provide classroom and other forms of support. In FY 2018 and FY 2019, Illinois 12
appropriated approximately $65,540,700 and $48,600,000, respectively to support bilingual 13
14 education programs in Illinois school districts. See Pub. Act 100-21, at 636–37 (Ex. 102); Pub.

15 Act 100-586, at 491 (Ex. 104). Currently, Illinois school districts receive funding on a per-pupil

16 allocation by level of service ranging from $304–758 per pupil. See ILL. STATE BD. OF EDUC.,

9

275. Separated children may also be eligible for healthcare programs that are partially

10 or fully funded by the State of Illinois, including Medicaid. In FY 2014, for example, Illinois
11 spent an average of approximately $2,108 per Medicaid-eligible child. See Medicaid Spending

15 22, 2018).

16

276. In addition, children who have been separated from their parents may access state

17 courts in Illinois in order to obtain Special Immigrant Juvenile Status (SIJS). In order to petition
18 the U.S. Customs and Immigration Services for a SIJS, a child must first obtain an order from a
19 state court finding that it is not in the child’s best interests to return to her home country or to
20 the country she last lived in, and that the child cannot be reunited with a parent because of abuse,
21
22 abandonment, or neglect. As additional children are brought to Illinois as a result of Defendants’

23 child separation policy, Illinois courts will see an increase in the number of orders being sought.

278. Once a UAC is placed with a sponsor who resides in New York State, the child 4
is entitled to a variety of services funded by the state, including educational services, early 5 6 intervention services, and access to healthcare, among others. New York State makes these
7 services available to such children in support of the State’s interest in ensuring the health, safety,

8 and well-being of all residents.

9

279. New York State will incur expenses to educate UACs placed within the state

10 because under state law, children ages six through sixteen who reside in New York must attend
11 school and are entitled to attend school up until age twenty-one. Moreover, the IDEA requires
12 the state to provide special education services to students with learning or emotional disabilities.
13
14 Under this federal law, children aged three to twenty-one are entitled to special education

15 services when clinically warranted. 20 U.S.C. § 1411. New York State law also entitles

16 qualified students to English Language Learner (ELL) services. N.Y. Comp. Codes R. & Regs.

17 Tit. 8, § 154. There are 692 public school districts in New York that serve approximately 2.6

18 million students. While costs will vary depending on the school district’s location and the child’s
19 needs, the statewide average to educate a student in New York is approximately $22,000 per
20
year. 21

22

280. New York State also provides a robust early intervention program which UACs

23 utilize when placed in New York State communities. The Part C Early Intervention Program

24 (EIP) was created by Congress in 1986 as part of the IDEA. The IDEA authorizes the 25 discretionary EIP for infants and toddlers with disabilities and requires states to provide a free 26

1 appropriate education for all students with disabilities, ages three to twenty-one. 20 U.S.C. §§
2 1411, 1419. Each year, New York’s EIP serves over 60,000 children ages zero to three who have 3
moderate to severe developmental delays. The EIP includes 1,279 providers that contract with 4
New York State to bill for EI services. Total annual expenditures for New York’s EIP total more 5 6 than $644 million across all payers—45% is covered by Medicaid, 2% by commercial insurance,
7 26% by state funds, and 27% by county funds. While EIP costs and services vary based on the

8 child’s needs and the intensity of services offered, for the 2017 program year the average cost of

9 services delivered ranged from $5,820 to $22,000 per child.

10

281. New York State also incurs significant medical expenses for each UAC placed in

11 state. UACs who are placed with sponsors in the community are eligible to enroll in the
12
Children’s Health Insurance Program (CHIP) operated by New York’s Office of Health 13

14 Insurance Programs. The yearly cost of CHIP per child is $2,607.36 and is financed exclusively

15 by New York State.

16

282. An influx of UACs also carries with it increased costs for the New York State

17 child welfare system. After a UAC is placed with a sponsor in the community, that placement
18 may be disrupted for a number of reasons. If the child becomes at risk of entering foster care—
19 for example, because of allegations of abuse or neglect by the person now legally responsible
20 for the child—the child welfare system will provide preventive services to attempt to keep the
21
22 child safely in the new home; such services are funded, in part, by New York State. If those

23 services are unsuccessful and the child must be removed from the new home, New York State

24 will also partly fund the child’s placement and needed services while in the foster system. 25

1 elementary and secondary level. This includes unaccompanied alien children who may be
2 involved in immigration proceedings. Once these children are released to a sponsor, they have 3
a right to enroll in Virginia schools regardless of their immigration status. In Virginia, some of 4
these unaccompanied alien children under 18 will be classified as homeless under applicable 5 6 state and federal law. See Va. Code Ann. § 22.1-3. Virginia school divisions are required to
7 immediately enroll homeless students. The Virginia Department of Education provides the state

8 share, and the enrolling local school division is responsible for paying the local share of the cost

9 for educating students enrolled in public schools at a total per pupil statewide average
10 expenditure in excess of $10,000. 11
289. Unaccompanied alien children may seek a variety of health services in Virginia. 12
For example, they need childhood immunizations and may seek testing and treatment when they 13
14 present with symptoms of a communicable disease. In Virginia, school divisions are required to
15 help any child classified as homeless obtain necessary physical examinations and

16 immunizations. Va. Code § 22.1-271.2. Moreover, if an unaccompanied alien child needed to be

17 hospitalized for emergency care, including psychiatric care, then Virginia would provide and
18 bear the cost of that care in part by absorption of costs by state-owned hospitals.

1 L. Defendants’ Policy Harms the States’ Quasi-Sovereign Interests

2

295. States have a quasi-sovereign interest in protecting the health, safety, and well-

3 being of their residents, including protecting their residents from harms to their physical,
4 psychological, emotional, or economic health. The States’ interests in preventing and remedying
5

6 injuries to the public’s health, safety, and well-being extends to all of their residents who will be

7 harmed by the Policy. The Policy has caused and will continue to cause severe and immediate

8 harm to the States’ residents, including parents who are detained, released, or otherwise reside

9 in the States after being forcibly separated from their children; children who are placed in
10 facilities, shelters, homes or otherwise reside in the States after being separated from their 11
parents; extended families and sponsors in the States; and the States’ immigrant communities. 12
296. The States also have an interest in ensuring that their residents are not excluded 13
14 from the rights and privileges provided by the U.S. Constitution, international laws, federal laws,
15 and state laws. These rights include due process and equal protection rights afforded to alien

16 parents and their minor children, and rights and protections under federal asylum and refugee

17 laws, international human rights laws, and state laws.
18 297. The Policy causes measurable harm to existing immigrant communities in the
19 States. A 2018 study published in the Journal of Adolescent Health finds that recent changes in
20 U.S. immigration policy that appear to target Latino immigrants have triggered serious

22 psychological distress for many resident Latino parents, including those living in the United

23 States legally. A substantial proportion of U.S. Latino parents reported adverse emotional and

24 behavioral consequences from recent immigration actions and news. For example, 66% said that 25 they very often or always worry about family members getting separated. Nearly 40% of parents 26

1 said they frequently avoided getting medical care, help from police, or support from social
2 service agencies because of reports about immigration actions. Parents who frequently 3
experienced worries or changes in behavior due to immigration news and policies had at least a 4
250% increase in the odds of experiencing high psychological distress, including clinical anxiety 5 6 and depression. The association between U.S. immigration actions and psychological distress in
7 this study held true after controlling for education, residency status, gender and other factors.

298. Many of the States have resident Latino and Hispanic populations that are

9 affected by the Policy and attendant distress. For example, as of 2010, 10.2 percent of the total

10 population of Washington State was of Hispanic origin, with some counties over 45%. Indeed,
11 roughly one in seven Washington residents is an immigrant, while one in eight residents is a
12 native-born U.S. citizen with at least one immigrant parent. The other States also have resident
13
14 Latino and Hispanic communities who are impacted by the Policy, as well.

15

299. Indeed, the States are already acting to try to protect the health, safety, and well-

16 being of persons separated and harmed by the Policy. As a result of the Policy, thousands of

17 immigrant parents and children are being separated and moved to a range of facilities or homes
18 in the States or being released to live in the States. Transfer of these separated immigrant parents
19 and children into the States will continue into the future as long as Defendants’ Policy remains
20 in place. See Exs. 55, 8, 21. In May 2018 alone, DHS took nearly 51,912 immigrants into
21
22 custody, nearly three times the number detained in May 2017. Ex. 55. The number of families

23 apprehended at the Southwestern border increased by 435% in May 2018 in comparison to May

24 2017. Ex. 8. The States have an interest in protecting those immigrants who are resident, or will 25 soon settle, in their jurisdictions. 26

300. Traumatized immigrant parents and children are already present in the States’

2 shelters and in federal detention centers in the States. On June 7, 2018, ICE spokeswoman
3 Danielle Bennett confirmed that because of “implementation of the U.S. Department of Justice’s
4 zero-tolerance Policy . . . ICE has entered into inter-agency agreements with [the Bureau of
5
6 Prisons (BOP)] to acquire access to more than 1,600 additional beds at [five] BOP facilities.”

7 These include 220 beds at the Federal Detention Center SeaTac in Seattle, Washington; 130 beds

8 in Sheridan, Oregon; and 1,000 beds at the Federal Correctional Institution Victorville Medium

9 Security Prison in Victorville, California. See Robert Moore, Immigration Officials Taking Over

301. Defendants’ Policy causes severe and lasting psychological and emotional harm

15 to immigrant parents in Washington who have been separated from their children. For example,

16 of the approximately 200 immigrants detained in Seattle as of June 19, 2018, 174 were women,

17 and dozens of those women were mothers who had been forcibly separated from their children,
18 whose ages range from one-year-old to teenagers. See Jayapal Goes Inside Federal Detention

1 children in weeks, and Defendants had not provided the mothers with any information regarding
2 the whereabouts or well-being of their children. Id. 3
302. These women described the horrific and inhumane conditions at the Border Patrol 4
facilities where they were previously detained, including fenced cages; lack of blankets and mats 5 6 notwithstanding frigid temperatures; and lack of access to food and water. Id. Some suffered
7 verbal abuse from border agents who called them “filthy” and “stinky.” Id. And they endured

8 further intentionally inflicted trauma when agents told them their “families would not exist

9 anymore” and that they would “never see their children again.” Id.

10

303. The specific stories of two immigrant mothers who are being detained in Seattle

11 confirm this horrifying experience. These two mothers crossed the border in Texas, immediately
12
turned themselves in, and were taken to a holding facility. The mothers were each separated 13

14 from their daughters upon arrival and held in a facility they describe as similar to a dog kennel.

15 The following week, the mothers appeared in federal court, were charged with illegal entry,

16 found guilty, and served time in Texas. After approximately three weeks, the mothers were

17 flown to SeaTac, where they remain in prison without their daughters.

18 304. A growing number of children separated from their parents pursuant to
19 Defendants’ Policy have been placed in facilities in Washington. These children have suffered
20
severe psychological and emotional trauma. 21

22

305. Similarly, a Brazilian woman who recently arrived in Massachusetts presented

23 herself for asylum at the U.S.-Mexico border and was detained and then separated from her 8-

24 year-old son. Immigration authorities determined that she has a credible fear of persecution if 25 she is returned to Brazil, so she has since been released pending adjudication of her asylum 26

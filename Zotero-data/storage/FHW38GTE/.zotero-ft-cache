Defendants.

17 I, Taylor Levy, declare as follows:
18 1. I am over the age of 18 and have personal knowledge of all the facts stated
19 herein.
20 2. I am the Legal Coordinator for Annunciation House, a charitable nonprofit in
21 the El Paso-Juarez border community. I have worked and volunteered with Annunciation
22 House for almost nine years, and been in my current position since January 2017. I am a Fully
23 Accredited Representative, which is an alternative accreditation that allows me to represent
24 clients in immigration proceedings before the Executive Office of Immigration Review
25 (Immigration Court). I frequently represent clients in Immigration Court who are seeking relief

1 from removal through asylum, withholding of removal, cancellation of removal under the

2 provisions of the Violence Against Women Act, and other forms of immigration-related relief.

3 I have also recently graduated from law school.

4

3. I have been working on immigration issues along our Southwestern border for

5 much of my career. For example, in the summer 2014, we began seeing a migration surge of

6 asylum seekers along our border communities. At that time, I first worked with Annunciation

7 House to coordinate an emergency humanitarian response to large groups of asylum-seeking

8 family units released on recognizance by Immigration and Customs Enforcement (ICE) in the

9 El Paso area. In August 2014, I changed roles to become part of the emergency pro bono

10 immigration legal team through Las Americas Immigrant Advocacy Center, providing

11 representation to asylum-seeking mothers detained with their children in Artesia, New Mexico.

12 I spent approximately five months in this role, traveling from El Paso to Artesia three days per

13 week.

14

4. The El Paso and Ciudad Juarez metropolitan area where I work is the biggest

15 border community in the world. The combined population of both cities is close to 3 million

16 people. El Paso and Ciudad Juarez are one of the main Southwestern border entry points into

17 the United States. Through my work, legal training, and physical proximity, I am familiar with

18 the conditions in our border community and interact daily with immigrants who have entered

19 the United States through the El Paso ports of entry.

20

5. Annunciation House is an independent organization rooting in Catholic social

21 teaching that accompanies the migrant, homeless, and economically vulnerable peoples of the

22 border region through hospitality, advocacy, and education. From its beginnings,

23 Annunciation House has sought to serve the most vulnerable people in our community.

24 Migrants and refugees, who often cannot receive services from most established social

25 agencies, have become the primary focus of our work over the years. Aside from our Executive

26 Director and me, Annunciation House operates with an all-volunteer staff.

6. Annunciation House has been located in El Paso/Ciudad Juarez since 1978, and

2 it operates three houses of hospitality for migrants and refugees. Apart from our general

3 population of guests, we also typically receive and serve 10,000-15,000 immigrants a year as

4 they are released from ICE custody. Many of these people travel on to other points in the

5 United States within a day or so, to stay with family as their immigration cases proceed.

6

7. Annunciation House is the entry point for most of our guests. It hosts guests

7 with short-to mid-term needs, who stay for weeks to months. These range from people who

8 have come to the US seeking work, to those who have fled violence and extortion in their home

9 countries, to undocumented families living in El Paso who have come upon financial hardship.

10

8. Casa Vides is a longer-term house of hospitality primarily for guests with

11 ongoing needs, such as political asylum cases or other immigration proceedings, or medical

12 situations. Casa Vides also provides hospitality to a number of Mexican nationals, widows of

13 U.S. citizens, who must spend a certain amount of time in the U.S. each year to collect the

14 Social Security benefits to which they are entitled.

15

9. Additionally, since 2014, Annunciation House has overseen approximately one

16 dozen different “overflow shelters” that serve our very short-term guests that have just been

17 released from ICE custody. The overflow shelters are primarily located in churches and

18 community centers, and they operate on a rotating basis depending on current needs and

19 volunteer availability. The guests in these overflow shelters typically stay just 1-3 days, long

20 enough to address their basic needs and connect with family or friends elsewhere in the U.S.

21 These overflow shelters have high turnover and unpredictable numbers, with the guest

22 population entirely dependent on ICE’s release schedule each week.

23

10. In the summer and fall of 2017, I began to see a significant increase in clients

24 that had suffered family separation in the El Paso area, meaning that parents were arriving at

25 the border with their children but being separated and detained by immigration officials for

26 long periods of time without reunification. Other advocates in our community reported similar

1 increasing separations during this time. This increase was later confirmed to be due to a shift

2 in Department of Homeland Security (DHS) policy.

3

11. Specifically, Annunciation House is a member of the Borderland Immigration

4 Council, a coalition of immigration attorneys and advocates. On Oct. 24, 2017, the Borderland

5 Immigration Council met with government officials in El Paso about immigration. It is my

6 understanding that representatives from Customs and Border Protection (CBP), ICE, and DHS

7 were present at that meeting and that they claimed that the new CBP policy was to separate

8 children over 10 from their parents when they were taken into custody.

9

12. During this time, I worked directly with two women (B. and J.), who had been

10 separated from their children soon after entering the country. Both women were being detained

11 in the El Paso Service Processing Center after having been separated from their minor children

12 and charged criminally with illegal entry after having been apprehended in the El Paso area.

13

13. I began visiting J. first in the late fall of 2017, after she made multiple calls and

14 sent letters to Annunciation House requesting assistance. I met with her for several months in

15 detention while attempting to place her case with alternate counsel due to a lack of capacity

16 within my own workload. I spoke about her case with various attorneys working with national

17 organizations as I sought counsel. I visited J in detention numerous times for several months,

18 including on Christmas morning; she was always despondent. I spoke to her son’s case workers

19 and legal team in Chicago and kept them informed of my ongoing efforts to assist J.

20

14. In January 2018, I was finally successful in securing immigration legal

21 representation for J through a joint partnership between Linda Rivas of Las Americas

22 Immigrant Advocacy Center and Innovation Law Lab. I then stopped working on the case. I

23 know that she ultimately became one of the named plaintiffs in a lawsuit in the Southern

24 District of California seeking reunification.

25

15. In April 2018, J was granted a bond from an Immigration Judge and began

26 living at Annunciation House. J has lived at Annunciation House since that time. It took more

1 than two months for J to be reunited with her son, who was being detained in Chicago, even

2 with the assistance of Annunciation House, Las Americas, and the ACLU.

3

16. In approximately January 2018, I also began assisting with the case of B,

4 another woman who had been separated from her minor child in the fall of 2017 after being

5 criminally prosecuted for illegal entry following apprehension in the El Paso sector. I began

6 working on her case as an unpaid “on-the-ground” consultant for her immigration lawyers from

7 ALDEA-The People’s Justice Center, an organization headquartered out of Pennsylvania. I

8 visited with B in detention and consulted with her attorneys. B was eventually granted an

9 immigration bond in March 2018 and came to stay at Annunciation House. She has since

10 reunited with her family outside of El Paso.

11

17. Following B’s release from detention, on March 12, 2018, Annunciation House

12 held a press conference to decry the practice of family separation. The press conference

13 included the Annunciation House Director, Ruben Garcia; an Assistant Federal Public

14 Defender, Sergio Garcia (B’s criminal attorney); Christina Garcia from Las Americas

15 Immigrant Advocacy Center; private immigration attorney and member of the Borderland

16 Immigration Council Eduardo Beckett; B; and myself.

17

18. Following the Press Conference, a journalist, Angela Kocherga, from the

18 Albuquerque Journal reached out to DHS for comment. The following was published in that

19 article: “DHS does not currently have a policy of separating women and children,” said Tyler

20 Houlton, acting DHS press secretary in an emailed statement. “However, we retain the

21 authority to do so in certain circumstances – particularly to protect a child from potential

22 smuggling and trafficking activities.” See https://www.abqjournal.com/1145759/advocates-

23 decry-immigration-tactic.html. I also read other articles in the press reporting similar

24 statements denying family separation from DHS spokespersons.

25

19. I am aware that on or about May 7, 2018, the press reported on an internal DHS

26 memo that confirmed that DHS had piloted a secret test of the family separation policy in the

1 El Paso area during July–November 2017. These news reports confirmed what I had observed:

2 that DHS was intentionally separating families as they entered at the El Paso border as a

3 deterrent to future immigrants. These news reports coincided with Attorney General Sessions’

4 formal announcement of the “Zero Tolerance” border prosecutions policy, which effectively

5 mandated family separation along the entire border.

See

6 https://www.texasmonthly.com/news/homeland-security-promises-to-prosecute-100-percent-

7 of-illegal-immigration-cases/

8

20. After the announcement, I began to hear reports from other border areas that

9 CBP and ICE were systematically turning asylum seekers away from ports of entry in other

10 Southwestern border communities. I initially dismissed these reports as arising from a few

11 individual CBP officers who were acting unlawfully, as I did not see a similar pattern in our

12 El Paso community. While as early as the fall of 2016, I had heard some anecdotal reports of

13 “metering”– a term that is frequently used to describe techniques to slow the number of asylum

14 applicants who enter at any one time – at El Paso points of entry, I believed that these were

15 isolated incidents.

16

21. During a press event in May 2018, I responded to a reporter’s question by

17 stating my belief that local ICE and CBP officers were not refusing to accept asylum seekers

18 in our area. At that point, a nun from our community who was sitting in the audience raised

19 her hand and offered that she had observed such refusals on the Paso del Norte, El Paso’s main

20 port of entry. That week, Annunciation House received a noticeable smaller number of ICE

21 releases. Because of the week of lower client numbers, coupled with the reports from

22 colleagues in other areas, increasing rumors in our community, and the nun’s remarks, I

23 decided to observe for myself what was occurring at the Paso del Norte.

24

22. On May 25, 2018, at approximately 9:30 a.m., I went to the Paso del Norte

25 alone to observe. The Paso del Norte is the main bridge into El Paso from Mexico, and to the

26 best of my knowledge, it sees more than 10,000 pedestrians crossing per day, traveling between

1 the two countries. When I arrived that morning, there were CBP officers stationed near the

2 middle of the bridge—where the border line is—but actually standing in a shady spot 5-10 feet

3 onto U.S. soil. I observed them for approximately two hours, including during a few apparent

4 shift changes when different CBP agents relieved the agents stationed at the middle of the

5 bridge.

6

23. During those two hours, I watched the CBP officers conduct “random”

7 identification checks of people crossing the middle point of the bridge. The officers did not

8 appear to have a system (e.g., every ten people) for the checks; instead, to my observation, they

9 primarily stopped those entrants who appeared to be Central American, particularly shorter,

10 darker skinned people. During that time, I watched them turn away two people. I then

11 approached those two people to ask what had happened; neither identified themselves as

12 asylum-seekers. One was seeking assistance with obtaining medical records and the other said

13 that he was simply waiting for a friend and had accidentally walked too far on the bridge.

14

24. At around 11:30 that morning, I watched a short, dark skinned man with a child

15 approach the border and cross the middle of the bridge at the border line and into the United

16 States. The CBP officers stopped the man. While I could not initially hear what they were

17 saying, I watched them gesture to him to go back. As I watched, the CBP officer gestured

18 forcefully again three times to the man to turn back and cross the border back into Mexico. I

19 heard the CBP agent say to the man, “para alla” (“go there”), while gesturing forcefully

20 towards Mexico. The man finally turned back.

21

25. When the man crossed back across the border line back into Mexico, I stopped

22 him and introduced myself. He began shaking and crying. He told me that he was fleeing

23 violence in Guatemala with his six-year-old son and that he had come to request asylum. As I

24 had observed, he was prevented from presenting his claim by the CBP officers who he said

25 told him to go away and that he cannot seek asylum. We stood and spoke for a while about

26 what had happened and his intentions to seek asylum. The man was very afraid to return to

1 Mexico or to Guatemala. After this discussion, I offered to accompany him if he wanted to

2 enter again to present his asylum claim.

3

26. Together, the three of us began walking back across the middle point of the

4 Paso del Norte Bridge. As we passed the border line at the middle of the bridge, and came into

5 the United States, the same CBP officers stopped us. “Didn’t we already tell you to go back?”

6 one of them said to the man. They once again asserted that he could not come in to the United

7 States.

8

27. I explained to the CBP officers that I was accompanying the man and his son in

9 their attempt to lawfully assert a claim for asylum. Our conversation escalated, and the CBP

10 officers called on their radio, saying “we have some noncompliants here,” “we need a

11 supervisor,” and requesting additional support. Shortly thereafter, additional officers arrived,

12 for a total of the two original CBP officers and four supervisors. They repeatedly told the man

13 in my presence that he could not enter and claim asylum, that he and his child had to “wait

14 until there was space” and similar statements.

15

28. During the course of our conversation, the CBP agents, including supervisors,

16 made the following statements to me or in my presence: “We have orders not to let anybody

17 in. As soon as we have room, yea.” “We have an order.” “This is a policy across the border.”

18 “There is no room for them right now. You can wait in line. Once there is room they can come

19 in.” “They can wait until we have room for them.” “It's an order from Sessions.”

20

29. After I protested that the refusal was unlawful and that the man was already on

21 American soil, the CBP officers eventually relented and allowed the man and his son to proceed

22 to have their asylum claim entered for processing.

23

30. After this incident, the two men I believe to be CBP supervisors pulled me aside

24 and said, approximately, “we’re all good now, right? We are being told to do this. We have

25 bosses too.”

1

31. Two days later, the man and his son were released from ICE custody pending

2 resolution of their asylum claims. I believe that had I not been present and willing to directly

3 advocate for their right to present their claims at the port of entry, that CBP officers would

4 have continued to deny them entry until they either gave up or attempted to enter elsewhere.

5

32. This experience was very upsetting on a personal level, as someone who has

6 dedicated her work to immigrant communities and the law. I had only just recently graduated

7 from law school a few days earlier and was shocked to hear CBP agents refusing to allow this

8 young man and his small child to be processed properly in accordance with the law. It was

9 especially infuriating to be told by the agents that there was no space to process these people

10 when I knew personally from my work with Annunciation House that this was simply not true.

11 Regardless, even if there was an actual lack of capacity at the bridge, the Immigration and

12 Nationality Act and U.S. treaty obligations do not allow agents to reject asylum-seekers for

13 alleged lack of capacity, especially when already standing on American soil.

14

33. About a week later, on May 30, 2018, I returned to the Paso del Norte with

15 others, including the Executive Director of Annunciation House, Ruben Garcia, and a local

16 reporter Bob Moore. Again, we went with the express purpose of observing whether CBP

17 officers were refusing to allow asylum seekers to enter the country.

18

34. We observed a group of about 15 Guatemalan refugees who had reportedly

19 spent the night on the bridge after having been turned away the day before. We spoke with

20 them, and confirmed that all were seeking asylum and had been turned away from the border

21 multiple times. Many members of the group were fathers traveling with their children, but

22 there was also one mother with a three year old child and several unaccompanied minors.

23

35. After hearing their stories of being turned away, we decided to accompany the

24 mother and one of the unaccompanied minors, a teenage girl, as they tried again to present

25 themselves at the port of entry.

36. Again we crossed the center of the bridge, over the border and onto U.S. soil.

2 CBP officers stopped us, and told us and the women that there was “no space” and that they

3 would have to come back some other time. In response to my protests that refusing an asylum

4 applicant on U.S. soil is unlawful, again the officers called for a supervisor to assist with

5 “noncompliants”.

6

37. When the supervising officer arrived with other CPB officers, he asserted that

7 the CBP was not “turning people away,” but that they were not allowing people to cross until

8 there was space. As we continued to discuss, one of the officers who was carrying a large gun

9 moved to stand very near the mother with her three-year-old son. I observed her to be

10 frightened and intimidated by his behavior, which I believe to have been intentional. The man,

11 who was not wearing a name tag or other identification, then deliberately discharged his Taser

12 at the ground right in front of us.

13

38. After more discussion, the CPB officers finally agreed to accept the women for

14 asylum processing; once again, this seemed to occur in part because I pointed out that we were

15 already standing on U.S. soil. Before we escorted them to the processing area, we saw one of

16 the fathers and two other boys from the group standing on the U.S. side of the border. We

17 explained to them that they did not have to leave, and were entitled to have their asylum

18 applications heard. We left to accompany the other women to the processing area, leaving the

19 other asylum-seekers behind. I did not return later to the bridge myself, but heard from Ruben

20 Garcia and another Annunciation House volunteer that when they returned approximately an

21 hour later with food and water, they could not find anyone else from the group.

22

39. Bob Moore, who was present, reported on these events. See Bob Moore, Border

1 published, and both then and now I believe it to be an accurate recording of the events that he

2 describes.

3

40. On or about June 20, 2018, I again went to Paso del Norte Port of Entry to

4 observe and accompany asylum-seekers with Ruben Garcia. While I was walking across the

5 bridge, I once again observed CBP officers stationed at the center of the bridge and checking

6 documentation.

7

41. We crossed into Mexico and met up with two families of asylum-seekers who

8 had previously been denied entry by agents stationed at the middle of the bridge. Annunciation

9 House had become aware of these families through our contacts with nongovernmental

10 humanitarian organizations in Ciudad Juarez. The two families were Mexican asylum-seekers

11 with small children and they had agreed to allow the press to document the process of trying

12 to seek asylum at the Paso del Norte Port of Entry.

13

42. There were approximately 30 reporters who joined us as we accompanied the

14 two families across the bridge. At the middle point of the bridge, CBP agents once again turned

15 us away, stating that they had no space. Several news outlets have published reports and video

16 of the encounter. The agents did tell us that we could wait until there was space, and the two

17 families were eventually permitted to cross the border onto U.S. soil and be processed as

18 asylum-seekers.

19

43. Since the formal announcement of DHS’ family separation policy,

20 Annunciation house has seen a great number of separated parents. Many of these parents report

21 that it was only when they had been turned away at the port of entry – sometimes multiple

22 times – that they attempted to cross elsewhere and were prosecuted for unlawful entry.

23

44. For example, on June 29, 2018, I interviewed a young woman from Guatemala

24 who was recently released from ICE custody after paying an immigration bond. She has not

25 seen her 3-year-old daughter in more than 2 weeks. This young woman explained to me that

26 she spent 2 days and 2 nights on the Paso del Norte Port of Entry with her 3-year-old trying to

1 present herself for asylum-processing. She told me that she was turned away by the agents at

2 the middle of the bridge several different times during those two days. Finally, someone

3 walking on the bridge suggested that she instead try walking against pedestrian traffic on the

4 other side of the bridge to present herself that way. Out of desperation—after having spent 2

5 days in the hot son on the bridge with her 3-year-old—this young woman decided to follow

6 the man’s advice. She crossed the bridge horizontally and began walking against the pedestrian

7 traffic leaving the U.S; this was in broad daylight. She was quickly apprehended by CBP agents

8 and charged with unlawful entry even though she was still on the bridge, just walking in the

9 wrong direction. She was then forcibly separated from her daughter.

10

45. On June 30, 2018, I interviewed a man from Honduras who is currently detained

11 in the El Paso area after having been separated from his 3-year-old son since approximately

12 May 25, 2018. This man told me about attempting to cross the Paso del Norte Port of Entry

13 three times before eventually deciding to enter irregularly. This man told me that during his

14 first attempt, he was not stopped at the middle of the bridge and actually made it all the way to

15 building at the end of the U.S. side of the bridge where he waited in line and presented himself

16 for asylum to a CBP agent. The CBP agent ordered him to leave the building, saying they had

17 “orders from Washington” to not allow anyone else in. The man left the building to take his 3-

18 year-old son to the public restrooms right outside; he then returned from the bathroom and got

19 on his knees in front of the CBP agent and begged to be allowed in for asylum processing. The

20 CBP agent yelled at him and told him to get up and leave, while putting his hand on his gun

21 menacingly. The man left. A few hours later, he decided to try and cross again, this time being

22 turned away by CBP agents near the middle of the bridge, but several feet onto U.S. soil. The

23 next day, he tried to cross the bridge once again, but was turned away this time by a Mexican

24 official who was standing near the bridge and told him to leave or her would call Mexican

25 immigration. It was only then that this man decided to attempt to cross the border irregularly.

46. When ICE releases separated parents from custody here in El Paso, the parents

2 are transported to our facility by bus or by van and dropped off with a 1-800 number for the

3 Office of Refugee Resettlement (ORR) to call to try to locate their children. These mothers

4 and fathers have almost no information about when they will be reunited with their children,

5 and they arrive here terrified and shaken by their experience.

6

47. For example, on last Sunday, June 24, 2018, we received 32 parents who had

7 been separated from their children. These parents arrived at Annunciation House absolutely

8 despondent. The youngest separated child in the group of parents was only 4 years old, while

9 the average age was 10 years old. The average length of separation was 25 days and the max

10 was 40 days. Ninety-one percent of the parents said that they had never once spoken with their

11 child since separation (though the majority said that their friends or family had been contacted

12 by their children’s social workers). Five of the parents reported that no one in their families

13 had heard from the children since separation—they had absolutely no idea about their

14 locations. It took Annunciation House volunteers four days and numerous phone calls to

15 random social workers of other parents to find the location of one of these children; during

16 those four days, we never received a call from ORR despite multiple calls to the ORR 1-800

17 number.

18

48. In my experience, ORR generally requires sponsor families who want to host

19 an unaccompanied minor to complete a series of procedural checks. These include criminal

20 background checks, fingerprinting, sometimes a blood test, and detailed financial information.

21 ORR frequently requires a sponsor family to pay for the cost of airfare for the child and a

22 roundtrip ticket for an ORR companion to accompany the child. A true and correct copy of

23 ORR’s Family Reunification Packet is attached hereto as Exhibit B.

24

49. The separated mothers and fathers that have arrived at Annunciation house

25 recently are struggling to navigate ORR’s reunification paperwork. They are being treated as

26 new ORR sponsors – subject to a host of paperwork and procedural hoops – rather than the

1 acknowledged parents of their children. Their social workers are insisting that they would

2 need to file all the Family Reunification paperwork and come up with airfare for their children

3 and ORR escorts before they would see their children again. All of these parents are deeply

4 worried about the ORR process taking too long and being overly cumbersome, especially given

5 their emotional states and long periods of separation.

6

50. As such, the majority of these parents have decided to travel to their family and

7 friends in other cities across the U.S. Annunciation House is maintaining contact with these

8 parents and attempting to match them with pro bono legal counsel in their receiving

9 communities. We are also attempting to help them navigate the complex ORR bureaucracy.

10

51. At least two parents have chosen to remain in El Paso while we attempt to

11 reunite them with their minor children (all three of whom are under the age of 10). In the case

12 of these two parents, their minor children are in ORR custody in El Paso. However, both

13 parents were originally told by their children’s social workers that it was impossible for them

14 to reunited with their children while living at our shelter. I was able to speak to both of these

15 social workers on Friday, June 29, and they told me that they were asking their supervisors

16 about reunification at our shelter. We are currently assisting them with the standard ORR

17 reunification packet, but this seems to be an unnecessary bureaucratic burden—as of today,

18 these two parents have been living at our shelter for an entire week, but they do not have their

19 children back, even though they are in ORR custody just a few minutes away.

20

52. On Wednesday, June 27, 2018, seven separated mothers arrived at

21 Annunciation house after being released by ICE from three separate jails. These mothers had

22 been told by CBP that they were on their way to be reunited with their children immediately;

23 they all believed that their children were already at our shelter waiting for them. When they

24 arrived and realized that their children were not there, they were heartbroken. I personally

25 observed the pain and trauma that they experienced in that moment.

agents, asked for documents, and told they would not be allowed to go further into the United States because of capacity issues. So began a tense standoff Saturday that marks an escalation in U.S. tactics to keep immigrants out of the country—including those legally entitled to enter and seek asylum—and relieve crowded immigration facilities that officials say are filled beyond capacity.
“I know you’re not at capacity. I know that’s what you’ve been instructed to say,” said Ruben Garcia, a 72-year-old who was inspired by Mother Teresa to found Annunciation House in 1976. He has a good handle on how many people are being detained at the bridges, because Immigration and Customs Enforcement eventually releases many of them to Annunciation House. Taylor Levy, a recent law school graduate who is working with Annunciation House, told the agents they were legally required to let the Guatemalans make their asylum claim because they are already several steps inside the country, a boundary that exists at the bridge’s apex.
The two CBP agents, whose nametags identified them as Armendariz and Avila, politely but firmly held their ground. Garcia asked to speak to a supervisor, and they made the call. Before the supervisor arrived, another agent came up to the group. His nametag was obscured by a tactical vest and a semiautomatic rifle.
The agents said they had been assigned to check IDs as people cross the boundary line, a highly unusual effort coming at a time when President Trump is expressing increasing frustration that his administration cannot control the nation’s borders—a key campaign promise of his. IDs are usually required a couple hundred yards further north, and well into U.S. soil, at the port of entry, where people make citizenship and customs declarations—and apply for asylum. And while the agents at the top of the bridge said they were checking the identification of all people walking across the bridge, Levy noted that the agents weren’t checking many IDs other than those of people with the dark skin and threadbare clothing that is typical of many Central American migrants.

Saturday morning, Garcia got a report that a group of Guatemalans was encamped in Juárez after being unable to cross the bridge. He invited me to accompany him and Levy as they investigated. We walked south across the Paso del Norte Bridge, the busiest pedestrian crossing between El Paso and Juárez, and saw two CBP agents standing at the top of the northbound pedestrian lanes. Minutes after crossing into Mexico, we spotted a group of about a dozen people huddled near public restrooms at the Mexican immigration office, one of the few spots offering shade. They told us that they had come from Guatemala and had been turned back by U.S. authorities the previous night.
CBP officials confirmed what Garcia has been hearing from immigrants, both at the bridge on this Saturday and in previous weeks at the Annunciation House shelter.
“Regarding what you witnessed today, U.S. Customs and Border Protection (CBP) is taking a proactive approach to ensure that arriving travelers have valid entry documents in order to expedite the processing of lawful travel,” agency spokesman Roger Maier said in an email. “That being said, CBP processes undocumented persons as expeditiously as possible without negating the agency’s overall mission, or compromising the safety of individuals within our custody.
“The number of inadmissible individuals CBP is able to process varies based upon case complexity; available resources; medical needs; translation requirements; holding/detention space; overall port volume; and ongoing enforcement actions. No one is being denied the opportunity to make a claim of credible fear or seek asylum. Once space is available and/or other factors allow then CBP officers allow more people into our facilities for processing. This has been occurring intermittently as needed for about a month here in El Paso and other locations as well where the volume of arriving people exceeds the capacity of our facilities.”
Garcia, Levy, and other advocates for migrants say federal law prohibits agents from turning away people who say they want to seek asylum, which is a means of legal entry in to the United States. The Immigration and Nationality Act states: “Any alien who is physically present in the United States or who arrives in the United States … irrespective of such alien’s status, may apply for asylum.” The

Case 2:18-cv-00939-MJP Document 15-3 Filed 07/02/18 Page 21 of 322

American Immigration Council last year filed a federal lawsuit in California challenging what it said was the Trump administration’s efforts to illegally thwart the efforts of asylum seekers. The case is pending.
The group of Guatemalans gathered on the Mexican side of the Paso del Norte Bridge were the latest to be caught up in the Trump administration’s efforts to reduce illegal immigration and clamp down on what it sees as exploitation of the asylum process. The group included several men traveling with their sons; a couple of teenage boys traveling without parents or guardians; the woman and her baby; and the 16-year-old girl traveling by herself.
Garcia and Levy introduced themselves and asked the migrants about their stories. They came from different villages but told similar tales of fleeing intense poverty, a corrupt government, and violent street gangs who were trying to dragoon young boys. The men and their sons wept openly as they spoke. The young mother told Garcia and Levy that she had been raped in Guatemala.
The only young girl in the group was more reticent to discuss what caused her to flee her home. “The pieces that she put out there was that she would go to school and then she would lock herself up in her room when she would come back. And I tried to get from her, ‘Why do you feel you need to do that?,’ and I couldn’t get an answer to that,” Garcia said.
One man, barely over five feet tall and wearing a tattered orange t-shirt, told Garcia that his two sons had joined him on the trek from Guatemala. But as they attempted to cross the bridge earlier that day, he had gotten separated from his sons, who crossed the bridge while he was turned back. The man sobbed as he told his story.
“He said there was a group of people and they kind of merged in with that group, kind of included themselves in that group. So they got in and he didn’t, which is going to create a huge problem for him, huge problems not being with his kids,” Garcia said.
Levy and Garcia huddled briefly to determine how to proceed. They decided to focus their efforts on the teenage girl, as well as the mother and child. Garcia told

the group of men and boys a bit about the U.S. asylum process, telling them they had to make such decisions themselves. He and Levy then began walking up the bridge with the mother, her baby, and the teenage girl. That’s when they were met by the agents blocking their path at the top of the bridge.

“I’m Following Directions”
After the initial standoff with agents Armendariz and Avila at the top of the bridge, a supervisor arrived. He introduced himself as Agent Gomez and recognized Garcia, who has a long history of working with border law enforcement agencies.
“This mom is saying to me, ‘I am afraid to be in my country, I’m afraid to go back to my country,’” Garcia said. Gomez asked, in Spanish, where the three migrants were from, and Garcia said Guatemala. Gomez replied, “OK, well, they’re not in Guatemala,” meaning they were now in Mexico. Levy corrected him, pointing out that they were standing in the United States.
Gomez told Garcia that he couldn’t allow the Guatemalans to come forward because the holding cells at the port were at capacity. He reminded Garcia of past surges of Central American migrants that led to what the CBP official called “inhumane” conditions in packed port of entry holding cells. “We are not absolutely saying that they cannot (make an asylum claim), we are just saying that we cannot process them at this time,” Gomez said.
When Garcia said the law required CBP to process their asylum claims, Gomez said: “Sir, I’m sure you know I’m following directions. And this is not even local directions.”
Garcia wasn’t buying it. “I know by the numbers (of migrants) that ICE is turning over to us that there is room, because the numbers are low and they have been low this whole week,” he told Gomez.
Garcia and Gomez had been talking for about four minutes when Garcia asked: “So right now, as far as they are concerned, I’m understanding you to say you will not

allow them to present (for asylum).” Then Gomez changed course. “They are, as (Levy) pointed out, stepping on U.S. soil, so we are going to take them in” to process their asylum claims. Agents Armendariz and Avila escorted the mother, her baby, and the teen girl to the port of entry.
By this time, some of the other Guatemalans had made their way up the bridge. Four were standing just inside U.S. territory; three—including the father who had been separated from his sons earlier in the day— were on the Mexican side of the line. Two CBP agents who had been standing a few feet from the border stepped forward and stood directly on the line. I witnessed one of the agents, whose nametag said Augustin, take a couple steps into Mexico to prevent one of the Guatemalans from crossing into the United States. CBP spokesman Maier later said port officials denied that any agent crossed into Mexico.
Garcia told the two boys and two men who were just inside U.S. territory that they could not be ordered to move back across the line. He told them he was going to get some sandwiches and water in El Paso, and would return.
When he came back an hour later, everyone was gone. The four people who had been just inside the United States, gone. The other Guatemalans who had been in Mexico, either just on the other side of the boundary or at the foot of the bridge, gone.
Garcia approached the agents. “I said, ‘What happened to them?’ They said, ‘They went back.’ And I said, ‘What happened to the ones that were standing right here on this side of the boundary line?’ And they said, ‘Well, they went back as well.’”

5. Between the dates of June 13 and June 18, 2018, I interviewed eight children in

4 the Seattle area who were separated from their parent at the border and placed in Washington

5 State by the Office of Refugee Resettlement. My observations and their accounts are as follows:

6

6. G is 15 years old and originally from El Salvador. In her home country, G was

7 being threatened by a member of a criminal association. Her mother cried when G told her about

8 this person. G and her mother fled to the U.S. They arrived in Texas in early June, 2018.

9 Immigration officials at the border took them to a place G calls "the icebox."

10

7. They told her mother that G would be taken to another place where she would be

11 able to visit her. G and her mother said goodbye to each other while crying, but G's mother

12 comforted her, saying she was going to visit her wherever she was going. Only later did G

13 realize this was not true. As she recounted this moment, G was sobbing and visibly distraught.

14

8. G was taken to a shelter about 15 minutes away, where she was detained for three

15 days. G described this place as awful. It was a room with no windows divided in three by wire

16 fencing that made them look like three cages. 20 girls were detained in each cage. The place

17 was freezing because they kept the air conditioner on all the time, and each child was given a

18 mat and an aluminum blanket to keep themselves warm. The girls placed their mats in the floor

19 very close to one another, since there was not enough space to fit them more comfortably. Girls

20 as young as 3 years old were detained in this place and without their mothers.

21

9. G described an incident where a 4 year old girl was crying and walking towards

22 a female guard seeking comfort. The guard turned her away saying she had no time to lose and

23 the girl was disrupting her work. The older girls attempted to console the girl.

24

10. G felt hungry most of the time she was there because the food they provided her

25 wasn't good in quality or quantity. She could not sleep through the night; the guards would wake

26 1 all the girls up at 4 am to count them by kicking on their mats. When G was finally able to fall

I back asleep, guards woke the girls up again to feed them. G cried when she told me she kept

2 hoping her mother would show up to take her out of that horrible place, but that never happened.

3 G asked the guards if they knew where and how her mother was, but they told her they knew

4 nothing about her. G overheard a girl asking to make a phone call to her family, but she was

5 told they did not allow girls to make phone calls while detained.

6

11. During these three days, G had no idea where her mother was, or how long she

7 would be detained in that place. On the third day, G was told that since her mother did not show

8 up to pick her up, she was going to be taken to a home. She was taken to the airport, where she

9 flew to Washington State accompanied by two officers. She arrived in Washington State

10 approximately June 4, 2018, and it was a few days later when G was finally able to talk to her

I 1 mother. She told G she was still detained at the first icebox where Immigrations took her. G

12 again broke down in tears when she explained that her mother reports going hungry at the place

13 they are keeping her. She said her mother is her hero, a brave woman who always worked hard

14 to support her and give her the best she could. G said that no Immigration official has ever asked

15 her why they fled El Salvador.

16

12. V is 17 years old and originally from Guatemala. V came to the United States

17 with her father on or about May 13, 2018. Immigration officials in the United States took V and

18 her father to a house where they took away their belongings. They were then taken to another

19 house about two hours away. At this house they separated V from her father. The separation

20 was hard, V did not want to stay there without her father and cried when they told her they were

21 taking her father to another place. She was crying when they took her father away, and the guards

22 told her to shut up. V said she was detained for about three days in this place without her father.

23 The guards gave her a mat and an aluminum blanket, the place was really cold. They fed her

24 burritos and cookies about three times a day, it wasn't very good food so she didn't eat it most

25 of the time.

13. There were other 10 or 12 girls detained with V, some as young as 6 or 7 years

2 old. The guards scared the girls saying things like "You will see what will happen next to you

3 girls", frightening them. The guards told the younger girls they would betaken to jail afterwards,

4 which frightened them. There was a female officer who would tell them that was a lie and tried

5 to calm the girls down saying her colleagues were lying. On the fourth day, V was put on a bus

6 and brought to Washington state, arriving here on or about May 16, 2018. It was another 15

7 days before she was able to talk to her father, who she believes is still detained in Arizona.

8

14. As of the time of our interview, V had only been able to speak to her father once,

9 which caused her visible distress. She is worried about her dad being treated well. She is working

10 with a therapist because she has nightmares.

11

15. On her journey with her father, V got hurt and received deep scratches from

12 thorns in the bushes. At the time of our interview, she still had one thorn deeply lodged in her

13 shoulder that was infected. She reported that she had been given medication for it and received

14 treatment when she arrived to the home where she is currently living.

15

16. A is 15 years old and originally from Guatemala. A said that a man attempted to

16 rape her in her home country, but the Guatemalan police did nothing to find or arrest this person.

17 Her father decided to bring her to the United States. They arrived in Texas in mid-May, 2018.

18 Immigration officers at the border drove them both to an icebox, but they were separated once

19 they arrived and placed into different cells. They never warned them they were going to be

20 separated, so she did not get a chance to say goodbye to her father.

21

17. A was placed in a room with other 12 women and girls. Most of the girls who

22 were there were 17 or 16 years old, but there was one girl about 6 years old who was there

23 without her mother. A was detained at the icebox for three days. She did not like the food she

24 was given. The guards were angry and yelling, which scared her and the other girls.

25

18. A told the officer that interviewed her that she was afraid to go back home because

26 1 of the man that tried to rape her. The guard told her he did not believe her, that she was telling a

I bunch of lies. He also told A that her father was going to be sent to jail for a long time, which

2 scared A and left her very worried. A had tears in her eyes and was visibly upset while recounting

3 these events. A was then told her father had been deported so she was going to be taken to a

4 home. After three days of being detained in the icebox, she was escorted in a flight to Washington

5 State where she arrived on or about May 16, 2018. Afterward, she was finally able to contact

6 her family in Guatemala and speak to her father.

7

19. H is 13 years old and originally from Guatemala. She came to the United States

8 with her father around mid-May 2018. Immigration officers took them to a house where another

9 father and three kids were detained. They spent the night at this house and the following morning

10 the officers took her to another house, without her father. They did not let her say goodbye to

11 her father or tell them in advance that they were separating them. H started crying while

12 recounting these events and was unable to continue speaking for some time.

13

20. H reported that the guards threatened the people that they detained with separating

14 them and sending them back home, she overheard them telling others they would be jailed for

15 about 10 or 15 years, which scared her. The younger children were crying.

16

21. H arrived in Washington State on or about May 22, 2018. At the time of our

17 interview, H had not spoken with her father since they were separated. She believes he continues

18 to be detained in the US but she is not sure where he is. She was visibly worried about him and

19 could not talk about her father without breaking in tears. H had a hard time talking during most

20 of the interview, was visibly upset and broke down in tears frequently.

21

22. T is 12 years old and originally from Guatemala. T came to California with his

22 father but he was not sure when, he thinks in early January 2018. They were detained by

23 Immigration officers at the border and taken to a house that was basically a room without a

24 window. T could not tell night from day, so he is not sure how long they spent there. The room

25 was divided in what seemed like halls with low walls that divided them. Two people slept in

26 each hall. He and his father were given a mat and aluminum blankets to cover themselves.

23. When they woke up, immigration officials told T to say goodbye to his father,

2 and that his father was going to another place. T said this moment was sad, both cried, hugged

3 and said goodbye. T was then taken to another house where he was hungry most of the time.

4 He thinks he was detained at this house for two more days. He was sad because his father was

5 not there and he felt lonely. After those two days they flew him to Washington State where he

6 was able to speak to his family in Guatemala and to his father, who had been deported.

7

24. M is 13 years old and originally from Honduras. M came to the United States

8 with her father in early June 2018. They encountered Immigration officers at the border, who

9 took her backpack away and drove them both to the icebox. When they arrived the officers

10 separated her from her father, she went to a room where only women were detained. They told

11 her she was going to see him afterwards, but she never saw him again. M had tears in her eyes

12 while recounting this part of the story, and said she misses her father and was scared when this

13 happened.

14

25. M described the icebox as a very cold room with one window facing the offices,

15 so they could not see outside the room. The air conditioner was always on. They gave the girls

16 aluminum blankets to cover themselves. They fed her apples, cookies, chips and tacos. She was

17 hungry sometimes. She was afraid because her father was no longer with her. After a while, she

18 was taken to a second place, where people were separated in areas divided by wire fencing. M

19 said some of the guards were mean to people, they scolded them and told them "we are in charge

20 of this place, not you". It was only after she arrived in Washington State at the home where she

21 is now living that she was able to speak with her dad. Her dad is still at the icebox in Texas and

22 as of our interview, she had only spoken to him once.

23

26. D is 14 years old and originally from Guatemala. D came to Arizona with his

24 father about four months ago, but he is not sure when. Immigration officers at the border took

25 them to a house where they fed them a tamale and juice. The guards threw away their belongings,

26 and left them with the clothes they were wearing. Right after this, they moved both of them to

I another house where he was able to sleep with his father. They gave him a thin mat and an

2 aluminum blanket. The next day, Immigration officials moved them both to a different house

3 where he spent half a day with his father.

4

27. The following day, Immigration officials told D's father that they were going to

5 send D to a program where if he behaved well he was going to be able to stay in the United

6 States. D was sad and upset; he did not want to leave his father. D was taken to a home in

7 Arizona where he lived for a while. Weeks passed during which D had no information or contact

8 with his father. He was then transferred to the home where he lives now in Renton, WA, several

9 weeks ago.

10

28. D believes his father is still detained in Arizona. At the time of our interview, D

11 had been able to speak to his father only once. He would like to speak to him again, he wants to

12 know how he is doing, what food he is getting, and if they have given him clothes. D got

13 emotional while talking about his worries about his father, he was visibly affected by it.

29. MN is 15 years old and originally from Guatemala. He came to the United States

15 in January 2018 with his father. Immigration officials at the border took them to a house where

16 he spent two days with his father. Afterwards, they told MN his father was going to be deported,

17 so they had to move MN to another place. MN and his dad said goodbye, but officials never told

18 him or his dad where they were taking MN. MN said he was sad to leave without his father.

19

30. MN was taken to a place that he described as very cold, there were no mats or

20 blankets to rest and keep him warm. After a day he was sent to another location where they gave

21 him a mat and blankets. The food was not much, and MN was hungry. After a day or two, MN

22 was moved to a home he thinks is located in Arizona, where he was able to speak to his mother

23 in Guatemala.

24

31. MN was only able to speak to his father afterwards, when he learned that his

25 father had spent 22 days in jail and was deported without MN. MN was reluctant to speak much

26 about his father, in my observation he appeared very concerned about his father's well-being.

32. At the time of our interview, MN was in a home in Tacoma. He had been treated

2 by a dentist in Arizona who had filled a cavity, but he did not do a good job. The filling did not

3 last, and his tooth began hurting again. The day of our interview, his tooth hurt so much that

4 MN had not been able to eat that day. MN wants to be reunited with his parents and siblings.

5 He has asked for voluntary departure but has been told that he must wait 2 or 3 more months to

6 have a hearing with a Judge before he can see his family. In the meantime, MN says that time

7 goes by very slowly and that he misses his family very much.

8

33. Some of the other children I interviewed at the homes mentioned that when they

9 were being transferred from a home in one State to the one they are now living in Washington

10 state, they were told they were going to be reunited with family or that they were going to a

11 better and bigger home. They expressed anger and feeling deceived when, after their flight

12 landed in Washington, they realized they were brought to another facility and that reunification

13 was not actually planned.

14

34. On June 20th, 2018, I went with five colleagues from the Attorney General's

15 Office to visit the Federal Detention Center (FDC) located in SeaTac. We were received by

16 FDC's Warden and other authorities who took us first to a pod of detained women identified as

17 pod FC. The women who were detained in that pod gathered in the common area to speak to us.

18

35. We asked if any of the women there were mothers who had been separated from

19 their children at the border. The women told us there had been more than 10 mothers in the pod

20 that were separated from their children at the border, but that ICE had moved them out of the

21 FDC the day of our planned visit. When asked where they were moved to, some said that ICE

22 told the mothers they were going to be reunited with their children. They provided us a list of

23 names of some of the mothers that were moved that morning.

24

36.

Only two mothers who were separated from their children at the border remained

25 in that pod. I conducted a more detailed interview with one of those mothers. She cried and had

26 1 tears in her eyes from the beginning to the end of the interview. She has a 14 year old daughter

37.

When we finished with these two interviews, we were taken to women's pod FB.

4 Similarly to the previous pod, the women gathered in the common area and told us that 13 or 15

5 women who had been separated from their children at the border had been moved out of the FDC

6 that morning. They also provided us with names of some of the mothers that were moved that

7 morning.

8

38. A few days after our visit to the FDC, I looked up the names of the mothers that

9 were moved out of the FDC the morning of our visit, using the ICE detainee locator website and

10 Access Corrections website, and found out that most of those mothers are now detained in the

11 Tacoma Northwest Detention Center.

12

39.

Some of the women who were detained in pod FB told us about the poor treatment

13 they received while being detained by ICE at the border. They were detained in places they

14 called "hieleras" (iceboxes) because it was freezing in there. The floor was wet with water. The

15 detainees knew their personal belongings were stored somewhere there by ICE, so they requested

16 to get their coats back not to freeze in the iceboxes, but they wouldn't give them back to them.

17 She said that they were only fed two tacos in the whole day. They gave them water with ice to

18 drink, which was awful considering they were already freezing. They would sometimes provide

19 them aluminum foil blankets. The women weren't allowed to shower, and the guards would

20 make fun of them, telling them they stank.

21

40.

Some of the women described how when they were taken to the airport in Laredo

22 to wait for their flight to Seattle, they were detained in a small room from about 6 pm until early

23 morning. They weren't able to sleep because there wasn't enough room for them to lay down.

24 They were hungry the whole night because they weren't given any food. They also said they

25 were disgusted when they were given used stained underwear to wear.

The last pod they took us to visit was pod FA. FDC's officers warned us there

2 had been a case of chicken pox in that pod, so they were on quarantine. There were at least 7

3 women in this last pod who stated they had been separated from their children at the border. I

4 conducted a more detailed interview of one of these women. My team was able to interview

5 some of the other women. The woman I spoke with had come to the U.S. with her 11-year-old

6 only child, whom she hasn't heard from in over a month. The woman trembled while telling me

I, Nicole Elizabeth Ramos, declare as follows:

16

1. I am a U.S. licensed attorney practicing in the area of immigration law and human

17 rights. I am barred by the State of New York, and I am a former Assistant Federal Public

18 Defender. I am over the age of 18 and have personal knowledge of all the facts stated herein.

19

2. At present, I serve as the Project Director for the Border Rights Project of Al Otro

20 Lado, a nonprofit organization based in Los Angeles. The Border Rights Project provides pro

21 bono representation and know-your-rights education to refugees in Tijuana. As part of this

22 representation, I accompany asylum seekers who wish to present themselves to Customs and

23 Border Protection (CBP) officers at the San Ysidro port-of-entry (POE), and represent them at

24 their credible fear interviews before the Asylum Office. In addition, I work with asylum seekers

1 and other community advocates to document human rights violations by both U.S. and Mexican

2 immigration authorities against asylum seekers.

3

3. In my experience, refugees seeking asylum at the POE near Tijuana face a

4 widespread practice of CBP officers who refuse to allow them to access the legal process for

5 asylum. In December 2015, I first began accompanying asylum seekers to the port-of-entry.

6 Since that time, I have accompanied hundreds of asylum seekers to the port-of-entry over the

7 course of dozens of different occasions. In addition, I also served as an organizing member of

8 the legal team for five group presentations of asylum seekers from May 2017-May 2018, at the

9 San Ysidro POE. Of those asylum seekers dozens had been previously turned away by CBP

10 when they arrived at the port-of-entry to seek asylum.

11

4. With the exception of the large group presentations of asylum seekers, which

12 were executed with the accompaniment of significant media attention, I have frequently

13 observed CBP officers attempting to prevent asylum seekers from accessing the asylum process

14 in violation of their obligations under Title 8 United States Code, Section 1225 and the 1951

15 Refugee Convention. The following are some examples of the obstacles that I have witnessed

16 for asylum seekers attempting to present themselves at a POE in the last several years. These

17 accounts are not comprehensive, but they are illustrative of the barriers that asylum seekers

18 encounter here.

19

5. For example, on December 23, 2015, I accompanied a Salvadoran family, ABC

20 and his three minor children to the San Ysidro POE. ABC fled El Salvador because of death

21 threats and attempts on both his life, and the life of his then 16-year-old son. ABC was a

22 testifying witness against one of the gangs during the investigation of his coworker’s murder.

23 His teenage son experienced three attempts on his life for refusing to disclose his father’s

24 whereabouts, and refusing to join the gang. These attempts included being stabbed and

1 kidnapped, being shot as he rolled down a hillside after throwing himself off in an effort to

2 escape, and being beaten unconscious and left to die in the street.

3

6. Upon approaching the POE, I spoke with a CBP officer, indicating that ABC and

4 his family wished to seek asylum. The CBP officer told me that the family could not apply for

5 asylum at the POE, and they had to apply at the consulate. I informed the CBP officer that this

6 was not correct, and that inside the POE there was a line to the far left where asylum seekers

7 lined up, waiting to be processed by officials.

8

7. The CBP officer then asked me whether I was an attorney. I informed him that I

9 was indeed an attorney. He then inquired whether I was a U.S. licensed attorney or a Mexican

10 attorney. Only when I informed him that I was a U.S. licensed attorney did he allow us to pass

11 through the gate into the building of the POE.

12

8. During ABC’s processing by CBP, he reported that officers insisted that he

13 disclose the whereabouts of his children’s mother, which he was unable to do. Despite these

14 explanations, CBP officers threatened ABC and told him that if he did not disclose the location

15 of his children’s mother, that his children would wind up in foster care because he would remain

16 detained.

17

9. On or around December 28, 2015, I accompanied DE, a Honduran mother, and

18 her small child to the San Ysidro POE. DE was also then-pregnant with another child. DE fled

19 Honduras because of brutal domestic violence at the hands of her cartel-connected long-time

20 partner. In addition to subjecting her to years of brutal violence, he also attempted to have her

21 killed by other members of his organization who once pushed her into oncoming traffic.

22

10. After arriving to the POE, I approached a CBP officer and explained that I was

23 an attorney, and DE wished to apply for asylum. He stated that he was not sure whether she

24 could do that at the POE, and I explained that she could. He then allowed us to pass the gate into

25 the building of the POE.

11. On February 18, 2016, I accompanied FG, a 15 year old child, to the POE. FG

2 fled El Salvador alone after being threatened several times with death for refusing to join the

3 local clique and help MS-13. FG never knew his father, was abandoned by his mother, and left

4 to live with a grandparent at a very young age. FG was referred to me by Uriel Gonzalez, the

5 director of the Casa YMCA, a shelter for migrant youth in Tijuana. The basis for this referral

6 was because FG had previously tried to turn himself in to CBP on two separate occasions, at

7 both the San Ysidro and Otay POEs and had been turned away and advised that he had to apply

8 for asylum at the local consulate or at the U.S. embassy in El Salvador.

9

12. I approached a CBP officer with FG and explained that he was an unaccompanied

10 child from El Salvador, and that he was there to present himself for asylum. The CBP officer

11 advised that FG would have to apply for asylum at the consulate. I explained to the CBP officer

12 that I had already brought asylum seekers to the POE before to present themselves, and that I

13 already knew where FG was to wait for a CBP officer to process him.

14

13. The CBP officer asked whether I was an attorney, and I explained that I was an

15 attorney. He then asked whether FG had a completed asylum application. I advised the officer

16 that we did have a completed I-589. Only after this did he allow us to pass the gate into the

17 building of the POE.

18

14. On March 17, 2016, I accompanied HI, a Mexican transgender woman to the POE

19 to present herself as an asylum seeker. HI suffers from severe PTSD and a seizure disorder, is

20 the survivor of multiple sexual assaults and domestic violence, and was once a victim of human

21 trafficking. After advising the CBP officer on arrival that HI intended to apply for asylum, we

22 were permitted to pass through the gate to the POE building. I left HI standing in the line with

23 other asylum seekers and assumed that she would be processed several hours later. However, HI

24 was not processed until approximately 36 hours later, during 30 of which HI and other asylum

1 seekers had not been fed. Throughout HI’s entire encounter in the POE she was subject to verbal

2 degradation and abusive language by CBP officers.

3

15. At the end of May 2016, Tijuana experienced a significant increase in its refugee

4 population, with hundreds of people arriving overnight. This sudden spike in asylum seekers

5 included refugees from countries not typically seen in large numbers at that POE, including Haiti,

6 Sierra Leone, Congo, Cameroon, Bangladesh, Armenia, Ukraine, and Russia, in addition to

7 asylum seekers from southern Mexico and the Northern Triangle. In the weeks following, U.S.

8 and Mexican authorities developed an ad hoc plan to have asylum seekers first “process through

9 the shelters.” This required all asylum seekers to first go to one of the four main migrant shelters

10 in the city, even if they had never been to one, and give their name to be placed on a wait list.

11 Each day Grupo Beta, an arm of Mexican immigration authorities, would ferry asylum seekers

12 to the border in groups, with numerical limits, for processing by CBP.

13

16. On June 20, 2016, I contacted Casa Migrante, a migrant shelter in Tijuana, to

14 arrange for housing for a Mexican female asylum seeker JK and her daughter. My reason for

15 contacting the shelter, instead of simply accompanying JK and her daughter to the POE was

16 because I was advised by Ms. Viruete, the staff attorney at Casa Migrante, that all asylum seekers

17 had to process through the shelter system, regardless of nationality.

18

17. Ms. Viruete advised that asylum seekers would be placed on a waiting list, and

19 then taken down to the POE in groups, by Grupo Beta, in order to be processed by CBP. She

20 further advised that these instructions had come to all the shelters housing migrants, and were

21 the result of meetings between CBP officials and Mexican immigration officials after hundreds

22 of asylum seekers arrived at the POE and had been waiting to be processed for several days,

23 creating a humanitarian crisis.

24

18. On June 21, 2016, I met my client at Casa Migrante. After escorting her to the

25 room she would be sharing with other families, I made sure that JK was placed on the “list.” On

1 June 22, 2016, JK was brought down to the POE and processed by CBP officers. During JK’s

2 processing she was subject to verbal degradation and abuse. Even though JK explained that she

3 was the survivor of a sexual assault, the victim of an international criminal organization, and a

4 material witness for an ongoing FBI investigation (and even possessed a copy of the investigating

5 FBI agent’s business card) she was told by CBP officers that she was “full of shit” and a liar.

6 After telling her story to one officer, he told JK “no mames,” which, in Mexico, is a vulgar way

7 of saying “stop kidding”. I reported JK’s terrible treatment to the FBI victim services

8 coordinator.

9

19. The system of asylum seekers processing through the shelters was abandoned in

10 the summer of 2016 in favor of a new ticket system. Specifically, CBP officers began directing

11 asylum seekers to obtain a “ticket” from Grupo Beta, in order to seek asylum in the United States.

12 By obtaining a “ticket,” asylum seekers would be given a date, at some time in the future, when

13 the asylum seeker could return to the POE to be processed by U.S. immigration authorities.

14

20. During this time, construction began at the San Ysidro POE and all asylum seeker

15 processing shifted to the new Pedwest POE. At that time, CBP began refusing to process asylum

16 seekers who showed up at the two other POEs in Tijuana - the old San Ysidro POE and the Otay

17 POE. I am not aware of any legal basis for CBP to limit the processing of asylum seekers to one

18 POE, particularly since for some asylum seekers, any delay in entering U.S. custody could mean

19 the difference of life or death.

20

21. On August 4, 2016, I accompanied four Guatemalan youth (LM, NO, PQ, RS) to

21 the Pedwest POE. On or about July 20, 2016, they attempted to turn themselves in to CBP

22 officers at both the Otay and San Ysidro POEs, but were denied. Two were under the age of 18

23 years old.

24

22. I first attempted to present these youths to CBP officers at the San Ysidro POE. I

25 was advised by Supervisor Abts that all asylum seekers must first obtain a ticket from Mexican

1 immigration in order to be seen by CBP officers, even unaccompanied minors. He further

2 advised that processing of asylum seekers was only occurring at the Pedwest POE, a 15 minute

3 walk from the San Ysidro POE, and a nearly 30 minute drive from the Otay POE.

4

23. At Pedwest POE, I approached CBP Officer Saucedo and advised him that I was

5 an attorney, and that I was presenting unaccompanied minor asylum seekers. Officer Saucedo

6 advised that all asylum seekers, regardless of age, had to obtain a ticket from Mexican

7 immigration authorities, and could not be processed right at that time. I explained that under the

8 Trafficking Victim’s Protection Act, there were specific protocol for processing unaccompanied

9 minors, and that CBP had an obligation to process these asylum seekers in accordance with those

10 regulations. I then requested to speak with a supervisor. A female supervisor arrived, and after

11 explaining the situation to her, she advised Officer Saucedo that unaccompanied minors were

12 not subject to the ticket system, and accepted the children for processing.

13

24. On August 23, 2016, I held a mini-legal clinic at the office space of the

14 community organization Deported Mothers in Action. There I interviewed two young women

15 from Guatemala. Both were fleeing extortion threats by the gangs in their city. They had

16 attempted to enter the U.S. without inspection, through the mounts, approximately two weeks

17 prior. They were apprehended by CBP, whom they told that they feared return to Guatemala,

18 and their intention to seek asylum. However, neither woman was referred for a credible fear

19 interview. Rather both reported being physically manhandled by CBP officers, and literally

20 tossed back over the fence. One of the women showed me bruises and cuts on her legs from the

21 fall. Neither woman wished to try to seek asylum in the U.S. again after this treatment. Both

22 appeared very afraid.

23

25. On September 17, 2016, I accompanied VW, a Mexican woman, and her minor

24 child, to the Pedwest POE. I approached the CBP officer and explained that my client was a

25 Mexican citizen, and that I would not have her ask Mexican immigration authorities for

1 permission to apply for asylum in the United States. The CBP officer allowed my client to pass

2 through into the building of the POE.

3

26. As I turned to leave the POE, I could see some adult men, and male children lying

4 on the floor outside the gate. I approached them and asked what they were all doing there. It was

5 at this time that members of the group advised me that they were trying to apply for asylum but

6 that no one would talk to them. I immediately inquired of the CBP officer what was going to be

7 done about the people waiting to seek asylum. I was advised that if the men were Mexican, they

8 could stand in the regular pedestrian lane, and wait to be processed. However, if the individuals

9 waiting were from another country, that they would first have to obtain a ticket from Mexican

10 immigration authorities.

11

27. I then advised the group, which was for the most part Mexican citizens, to get in

12 the pedestrian line and to advise the CBP officer that they wished to seek asylum and wanted a

13 credible fear interview with an asylum office. Two members of the group waiting were from El

14 Salvador. I learned that they were cousins, and one was an unaccompanied minor, and the other

15 was only 18 years old. Concerned for their safety, I explained to the boys that I was an

16 immigration attorney, and if they wished, I would help them for free, and take them to a shelter

17 for migrant youth where they would be safe. They agreed, and from there I drove XY and ZA to

18 Casa YMCA.

19

28. The boys advised that they had been waiting at the POE for a few hours. They

20 explained that they initially lined up with the other pedestrians and walked through the first gate

21 into the POE without being stopped by a CBP officer. However prior to presenting for admission,

22 the boys were approached by a CBP officer who asked for their documents. The boys explained

23 that they were there to apply for asylum because they faced death threats in El Salvador. Both

24 boys reported that the CBP officer told them that they could not apply for asylum right there,

25 that they had to be put on a list. The boys were advised to go back out the gate of the POE and

1 wait there until someone came out to speak to them. The boys reported waiting there for almost

2 three hours without any CBP officer acknowledging their existence, despite them laying there in

3 plain view for hours in the hot sun.

4

29. On October 28, 2016, I spoke on a panel at a binational border rights conference

5 at Colegio de la Frontera in Tijuana. This conference was organized by the Los Angeles County

6 Bar Association. At that conference, Assistant CBP Port Director, Nancy Carrillo, spoke about

7 several matters, and fielded questions from the audience. During this meeting AD Carrillo

8 addressed the “metering” system in Mexico, through which asylum seekers obtained a ticket

9 from Mexican immigration authorities, and unequivocally stated that CBP did not have any

10 involvement with the ticketing system.

11

30. During the question and answer session of AD Carrillo’s presentation, I raised

12 the issue of CBP officers turning away unaccompanied minors, advising them to obtain tickets

13 from Mexican immigration, in violation of the Trafficking Victims Protection Act. Following

14 her talk, I approached her personally to advise her that I had serious concerns regarding human

15 rights violations occurring in the POE, and that I had collected significant data on this issue. I

16 advised her that I could send her this information in writing. She declined to receive such

17 document, and suggested I provide information through a “working group in San Diego.” The

18 gentleman standing next to her, who was also a higher-level official with CBP at the San Ysidro

19 POE (one of two other CBP officers in addition to AD Carrillo in attendance) advised me in

20 passing that he recognized my name “from a lot of paperwork” that I had been filing.

21

31. On November 15, 2016, I accompanied a Honduran family to the Pedwest POE.

22 The family consisted of three adults (two parents, and a grandmother), FG, HIJ, KL, and FG and

23 HIJ’s three minor children. KL is a senior citizen and mentally ill. The family fled Honduras due

24 to death threats by a gang who had kidnapped and held HIJ hostage for ransom for a week before

1 her escape. The family fled out the back door of their home just as the gang had arrived in front

2 of their house, with cans of gasoline to burn the family alive inside their home

3

32. At the POE, I spoke with a CBP officer and explained that this family was there

4 to present themselves as asylum seekers. Upon hearing my explanation, the CBP officer at the

5 gate advised that the family would first have to seek a ticket from Mexican immigration, and

6 they could not apply for asylum at that time. I requested to speak with a supervisor. A CBP

7 supervisor then came out to speak with me, and I advised the supervisor that the family was

8 seeking asylum. The CBP supervisor also advised me, as did the officer before; that this family

9 would first need to speak with Mexican immigration authorities and obtain a ticket before they

10 would be permitted to seek asylum from U.S. immigration authorities. I explained to the

11 supervisor that the ticket system was not designed to handle any other nationalities outside the

12 influx of Haitian migrants, and that Mexico was not dispensing tickets to individuals without the

13 appropriate voluntary departure documents, a particular document given to Haitian migrants at

14 the southern border of Mexico. There was back-and-forth discussion with the supervisor before

15 it was finally agreed that CBP would accept this family for processing.

16

33. On December 10, 2016, I organized a legal clinic to work with asylum seekers

17 who had been identified by local migrant shelters and human rights observers as having been

18 illegally turned away by CBP. At this clinic, volunteer attorneys worked with 8 people: two

19 brothers from El Salvador KL and MN; a Salvadoran couple, OP and her husband QR, and their

20 8 month old baby; a single man from Belize ST; UV, a man from Colombia; and XY, a former

21 policeman from Guatemala. All of these asylum seekers had attempted to present themselves

22 multiple times at the Pedwest POE. All of these asylum seekers were told by CBP that they first

23 had to obtain a ticket from Mexican immigration authorities.

1 United States. UV was involved in removal proceedings, was pursuing asylum relief, and had

2 been designated as eligible for Franco-Gonzalez protections by the Immigration Court. UV had

3 wandered into Mexico by accident, and had come to be interned and held against his will in a

4 rehabilitation center. UV had no recollection how he had been committed to this facility, as he

5 does not have a substance abuse problem. After securing UV’s release from the facility, I

6 presented UV to CBP officers at the Pedwest POE. Once again, I spoke with a CBP officer,

7 advising him that UV was a mentally challenged asylum seeker already involved in proceedings

8 in the U.S. I further advised the officer that we had with us court orders from the Immigration

9 Court stating that UV was mentally incompetent, had appointed counsel, and had a hearing date

10 in March 2017. A supervisor was called to come speak with us.

11

35. A few minutes later, Supervisor Wong approached with approximately four other

12 CBP officers. Supervisor Wong asked why we were at the POE, and I explained to him the same

13 information that I had explained to the previous officer. It was then that Supervisor Wong

14 advised that I was “not in court of law,” and that I had no right to present evidence. He further

15 inquired whether I was a member of the American Immigration Lawyers’ Association (AILA),

16 to which I responded that I was not in fact a member. Supervisor Wong explained that CBP and

17 AILA had been having meetings in which “the new policy” had been explained. However, when

18 pressed to discuss what that new policy was, Supervisor Wong merely stated that if I was a

19 member of AILA that I would know the policy. I inquired whether he was referring to the system

20 by which CBP officers were refusing to process asylum seekers without them first obtaining a

21 ticket from Mexican immigration authorities. Supervisor Wong advised that CBP had no

22 involvement in that system and that was not the process to which he was referring, without ever

23 clarifying the procedures asylum seekers were now to follow.

24

36. As a Mexican asylum seeker, UV was not even subject to the ticket system. When

25 Supervisor Wong approached us with four other CBP officers in tow, seemingly in a display of

1 official intimidation, my client immediately became very afraid as he has impaired cognitive

2 functioning mimicking that of a child. I advised Supervisor Wong that I was aware CBP would

3 not make a final decision on asylum, but that certainly asylum seekers could enter the POE and

4 present themselves as asylum seekers, as I had been accompanying asylum seekers to the POE

5 for a year. It was then that Supervisor Wong looked at me and stated “we know who you are,

6 and what you do.” It became clear to me then that CBP’s responses to me would become more

7 personal and retaliatory as I continued to accompany asylum seekers and demand they be

8 afforded access to the asylum seeker process as laid out in federal law.

9

37. On December 28, 2016, and on January 4, 2017, I accompanied Attorney Tatyana

10 Edwards to the Pedwest POE with her clients. On each occasion, we accompanied families from

11 the Uzbek Republic, consisting of two parents and two children in each family. On each

12 occasion, upon arriving at the POE, I explained to the front line CBP officer that I was an

13 attorney, there with an asylum seekers and their attorney. On each occasion, the front line CBP

14 officer advised that the family would first have to seek a ticket from Grupo Beta. On each

15 occasion, I requested to speak with a supervisor. On each occasion, after speaking with the

16 supervisor, we were asked whether the asylum seekers had brought with them immigration form

17 G-28 (Notice of Attorney Representation), despite there being no requirement for an asylum

18 seeker to be represented by an attorney to present themselves at the POE. After explaining to

19 each supervisor that these families would be denied the ticket by Grupo Beta because they did

20 not have the appropriate entry or exit documents for Mexico, the asylum seekers were permitted

21 to enter the POE and referred for a credible fear interview.

22

38. On January 3, 2017, I accompanied WX to the Pedwest POE, along with her three

23 minor children and her nephew. I approached the CBP officer at the front gate and advised that

24 I had a family of Mexican asylum seekers. A supervisor then came out to take the family for

1 processing. I provided the supervisor with the family’s turn-in packets, which clearly stated that

2 they were seeking asylum, and wished to have a credible fear interview with an asylum officer.

3

39. While waiting for the supervisor to arrive, I observed a CBP officer speaking with

4 a woman clutching papers who appeared to be crying. I then saw the woman walk away. I waved

5 to my paralegal and legal assistant waiting nearby so that they could intercept the woman, and

6 ask if she needed help. Upon leaving the POE, I spoke briefly with this woman, also a female

7 Mexican asylum seeker whose husband had been killed. She explained that the CBP officer at

8 the gate had advised her that Mexicans were no longer getting asylum and that if she persisted

9 in her claim the only result would be that she would be detained for a long time, and deported

10 anyway.

11

40. Within less than 24 hours, WX and her children were deported. She had no idea

12 where her nephew had been transferred, or whether he would be deported as well. WX contacted

13 me from the office of Mexican Immigration at the Pedwest POE to advise me she was in the

14 process of completing repatriation paperwork. I traveled to the POE and spoke with WX

15 regarding what had transpired. She advised me that CBP officers berated her for several hours,

16 before forcing her to recant her fear of return to Mexico on video. She made repeated requests

17 for counsel which were ignored. Indeed, she was advised that if counsel cared about WX then

18 counsel should have been there (despite the fact that CBP prohibits attorneys’ presence during

19 asylum seeker processing).

20

41. WX stated that CBP officers informed her that Mexicans did not qualify for

21 asylum, that the practice of accepting Mexican asylum seekers “had ended five years ago.” CBP

22 officers advised WX that if she did not agree to state that she was not afraid on video, she would

23 be banned from the U.S. for life, and never be able to fix her status. She was advised to return to

24 Mexico and apply for a visa. WX reported feeling emotionally beaten down by the CBP officers,

25 such that she felt like the only choice she had to make them stop berating her would be to do

1 what they were demanding of her. After hearing WX’s account, I brought her back to the POE

2 and requested to speak to a supervisor, advising the front line CBP officer that WX was an

3 asylum seeker who I had brought to the POE the day before, and who had been pressured by

4 CBP officers to recant her fear of return on video. I demanded that she be reprocessed and

5 referred for a credible fear interview. Supervisor Schneider arrived, and I explained the same to

6 her, that WX had been coerced by CBP officers into recanting her fear on video, and that I

7 expected her to be processed and referred for a credible fear interview in accordance with the

8 agency’s obligations under the law. WX was then taken back for processing by Supervisor

9 Schneider.

10

42. On January 20, 2017, I accompanied four asylum seekers to the Pedwest POE,

11 asylum seekers from El Salvador, 16-year-old, YZ and AB, his father, as well as YZ’s 18 year

12 old cousin CD. This family had fled El Salvador because of threats against their lives by the

13 gang MS13. CD continued to face attempts on his life by MS members sent to hunt him because

14 of his status as the last remaining witness to his sister’s kidnapping. Within a week, her body

15 was found, and since that time all other remaining witnesses had been killed, leaving only CD

16 remaining. In addition, all three Salvadoran asylum seekers had survived a kidnapping in

17 Chiapas, where they were held hostage in a house for one month, with approximately 30 other

18 migrants, and were regularly starved, deprived of sleep, and beaten with fists and objects.

19

43. On this same date, I presented EF at the POE. EF is 20 year old Mexican woman

20 with a gender-based asylum claim. EF’s asylum claim was based on a similar nucleus of facts as

21 that of her mother, who had received a grant of withholding of removal by an immigration court.

22 Within 24 hours, I received a call from EF stating that she had been deported back to Mexico. I

23 immediately went to the POE and interviewed EF regarding what happened. I later memorialized

24 that interview by producing a video declaration of EF describing what CBP officers had done to

25 her. Specifically, EF reported that CBP officers told her she did not qualify for asylum, that she

1 did not meet the requirements for “one of the six categories.” She was told by CBP officers that

2 Mexicans did not qualify for asylum. When EF tried to explain to CBP officers that she had an

3 attorney, and she wanted an asylum interview, she was told that if her attorney really cared about

4 EF then she would be present, but since EFs attorney was not present, they would proceed

5 without her. EF was further advised she had no right to an attorney, and that she had no other

6 choice but to recant her fear on video. It took a few takes for EF to be able to state on camera

7 what the CBP officers wanted her to say, i.e. that she no longer feared return to Mexico.

8

44. After completing EF’s video declaration, I returned with her to the POE, and

9 advised the front line CBP officer that I needed to speak with a supervisor. Shortly thereafter,

10 the chief on shift for the POE on January 21, 2017, came striding over demanding to know the

11 nature of my complaint. It was apparent from the outset that the chief was hostile to my presence

12 with my client. I explained to the shift chief, a tall African American gentleman, what had

13 happened, and demanded that EF be reprocessed, and referred for a credible fear interview with

14 an asylum officer. The shift chief became visibly agitated, and warned me that I had no right to

15 be there presenting clients, that they had to present themselves. I advised him that my presence

16 would not be necessary if the agency would comply with its existing legal obligations with

17 respect to processing of asylum seekers. I advised the shift supervisor that the violations against

18 asylum seekers have already been documented by journalists, including the Washington Post,

19 and that if CBP officers continued to violate the law, I would continue to ensure that these

20 violations were reported. The shift supervisor again told me that I had no right to be presenting

21 asylum seekers, before taking EF back for processing.

22

45. I have interviewed dozens of other Mexican asylum seeking families who have

23 also been forced to recant their fear of return under similar circumstances on video. All reported

24 being berated for significant periods of time until agreeing to consent to removal, and to

25 recanting on video.

46. On January 26, 2017, I accompanied Attorney Tatyana Edwards, another male

2 attorney, and Attorney Edward’s client, a Turkish asylum seeker, to the Pedwest POE. This

3 individual fled Turkey after being imprisoned by the government for his political views. His

4 passport, along with his still-valid U.S. visa had been confiscated by his government. Upon

5 arrival to the POE, I spoke with a front line CBP officer and advised him that we were there to

6 present a Turkish asylum seeker. He advised that the asylum seeker would first have to go to

7 Grupo Beta. I requested to speak with a supervisor, explaining that Grupo Beta did not give

8 tickets to individuals present in Mexico on tourist visas, like this particular asylum seeker.

9

47. Shortly thereafter Supervisor Gomez arrived. She was immediately hostile and

10 ordered the other two attorneys present, the Turkish asylum seeker’s actual legal representative,

11 to either enter the U.S. or to return to Mexico. Both complied with her order, and I was left

12 standing with the asylum seeker. I attempted to explain to Supervisor Gomez the basic facts of

13 this case, that the asylum seeker was a former political prisoner, whose valid U.S. tourist visa

14 had been confiscated by the same government which persecuted him. Supervisor Gomez

15 repeatedly told me, each time louder, that she would not speak with me, and that I had no right

16 to be there. She refused to check the system to determine whether the asylum seeker did in fact

17 have a valid tourist visa (and thus had been pre-vetted). She insisted that the asylum seeker first

18 obtain a ticket from Grupo Beta despite me repeatedly trying to explain to her that this was not

19 possible.

20

48. It was at this point that the interaction became more threatening. Supervisor

21 Gomez at this point was shouting to the client that I was a liar, and a troublemaker, and that she

22 knew that I had taught the client “how to lie.” She then threatened several times to have me

23 physically removed from the POE by Mexican authorities, Grupo Beta. Because of these threats

24 we left the POE, and I drove the asylum seeker back to his hotel.

49. On February 3, 2017, I presented eight asylum seekers at the POE, a Honduran

2 family consisting of two parents and two children, a Colombian gentleman who had been turned

3 away from the POE two times previously, two Mexican men, and the Turkish gentleman who I

4 had previously attempted to present unsuccessfully. I arrived at the POE with three reporters,

5 four other attorneys, and two other human rights monitors. Upon seeing the crowd, among which

6 several were dressed in professional attire signaling the possibility that they could be attorneys,

7 and noting that press were among us, CBP supervisors took the group in for processing.

8

50. I chose to present this group of asylum seekers in a group because I now feared

9 for my safety. In addition, I enlisted the support of Amnesty International, who developed a

10 check-in system with me to help ensure for my safety should American authorities again threaten

11 me with arrest by Mexican officials, and should those Mexican officials actually follow through

12 on that threat.

13

51. On February 5, 2017, I presented a Mexican woman and her two children at the

14 POE to seek asylum. GH had attempted to seek asylum at the POE two times before, the second

15 time the day before on February, 4, 2017, with the assistance of my colleagues Ian Philibaum

16 and Alex Mensing, independent human rights monitors. Despite them presenting GH to CBP,

17 with documents to show she was represented and seeking a credible fear interview, and despite

18 the fact that I emailed these same documents to the designated supervisor email for CBP

19 supervisors at the POE, GH was forced to recant her fear of return to Mexico on video.

20

52. GH was told that simply, by virtue of her being Mexican, she did not qualify for

21 asylum. She was threatened, that if she did not withdraw her asylum claim, that the "next time

22 she tried" to seek asylum, she would be facing a deportation.

23

53. When I re-presented GH to the POE on February 5th, I requested to speak with a

24 supervisor. Several minutes later, I spoke with Supervisor DeJesus, and explained that CBP

25 officers had been coercive and verbally abusive with GH, and that she had been removed despite

1 her request, and my clear written request, that she be referred to an asylum officer for a credible

2 fear interview. Supervisor DeJesus then advised me that they would “take her back and decide

3 what she qualifies for.” I reminded Supervisor DeJesus that making decisions as to eligibility

4 was not within his authority under Title 8 of the United States Code, Section 1225.

5

54. In March 2017, I began working with two families, one family of five from

6 Guatemala, and one family of four from El Salvador, both of whom had been turned away by

7 CBP when they sought asylum at the port-of-entry. These families later joined the large group

8 presentations of 94 asylum seekers at the San Ysidro POE in May 2017.

9

55. On the afternoon of April 9, 2017, at approximately 2:00 p.m., I, along with

10 Attorney Seungwon Chung, approached the Pedwest port-of-entry with DS, a Honduran asylum

11 seeker, and her three year old son, DG, a Mexican citizen, who was also seeking asylum with his

12 mother. Upon approaching the gate, Attorney Chung and I informed CBP Sergeant Pacheco that

13 we were present with an asylum seeker who was requesting a credible fear interview with an

14 asylum officer. Sergeant Pacheco asked what country the adult asylum seeker was from, and

15 whether the asylum seeker was a minor. We advised him that the asylum seeker was a mother

16 and child. Sergeant Pacheco advised us to stand to the side of the gate and to wait for a supervisor.

17

56. Several minutes later Chief Soto approached and engaged Attorney Chung. She

18 explained the purpose of our presence in the port-of-entry, and Chief Soto asked Attorney Chung

19 whether she was aware of the process that she must follow. Attorney Chung advised Chief Soto

20 that she was there to turn in a Honduran asylum seeker. Chief Soto then advised Attorney Sung

21 that the asylum seeker would have to go to INAMI (Mexican Immigration) to be placed on a list

22 and obtain a ticket, and that without this ticket, CBP would not process her.

23

57. Chief Soto's demeanor was hostile and insistent. He repeated that we needed to

24 follow the rules, however, when presented with the plain language of the statutory language

25 which requires CBP officers to refer asylum seekers for a credible fear interview with an asylum

1 officer, Chief Soto replied "I don't care." We attempted to show Chief Soto written

2 correspondence received by the Mexican National Human Rights Commission, in relation to

3 another asylums seeker's case, in which the Instituto Nacioal de Migracion, officially stated that

4 its agency is not responsible for giving asylum seekers tickets to seek asylum in the United

5 States. Chief Soto refused to read this one-page document. Chief Soto then indicated that he

6 would speak with us no longer, and that we needed to leave. Upon walking away, he advised the

7 other officers who were standing at the gate that they were not to allow us in.

8

58. On May 7, 2017, we presented 78 asylum seekers to the port-of-entry as part of

9 the Viacrucis Refugee Caravan. Of those asylum seekers, 8 family units -- totaling 39 family

10 members -- were previously turned away by CBP between the months of February and April.

11

59. Throughout the remainder of 2017 and into 2018, I have continued to present

12 asylum seekers at the POE, and routinely witness the kinds of resistance and obstacles detailed

13 above. In almost every instance in which I have accompanied asylum seekers to the port of entry,

14 CBP officers have attempted to turn them away. These interactions have often required a

15 supervisor to address the matter, and reiterate the refusal. These issues are so prevalent that in

16 July 2017, Al Otro Lado joined with individual asylum seekers to file a lawsuit challenging these

17 practices. That case is pending in the Southern District of California.

18

60. I understand that some of the recalcitrance that I have encountered with CBP

19 officers may have been a localized practice in the past, but it is also my understanding from my

20 colleagues in other areas of the Southwestern border that CBP officers’ refusal to process asylum

21 seekers who present at regular POE may be developing into a policy across the Southwestern

22 border.

23

61. I have seen crowds of asylum seekers gathered outside the POE due to refusal to

24 process by CBP for at least the last 7 months. Since the announcement in April 2018 by Attorney

21 ourselves at a United States point of entry and seeking asylum.

23 illness and that we did not have enough money for the bus ticket to travel to Tijuana, Mexico,
24 my partner and I decided to split up in the last part of the trip to reach Tijuana. We were
25 concerned about M.'s health because he was only 14 months old and we wanted him to reach a

I safe place as soon as possible. Because my eldest son A. wanted to stay with me, J. went ahead

2 with M. Before J. left with M., I made sure he was carrying his original identification and M.'s

3 original birth certificate.

4

5. On November 12, 2017, before J. presented himself at the San Ysidro point of

5 entry, I spoke with him. I confirmed that he was carrying his identification and M.'s birth

6 certificate and that the attorneys from Pueblo Sin Fronteras had made copies of the documents.

7

6. On November 12, 2017 J., along with other caravan families, presented himself

8 at the San Ysidro point of entry with M. Two days later, I arrived in Tijuana with A.

9

7. On November 16, 2017, I learned from other members of the caravan who crossed

10 successfully the border that immigration officers took M. from J. I felt as if someone had

11 dumped a bucket of cold water on me. I was very angry at J. for letting someone take the child

12 away from him.

13

8. When I was able to speak with J. he was very desperate and anxious and told me

14 that there was nothing he could have done to keep M. because the immigration agents threatened

15 to use force to take M. away if he did not give him up. J. did not know where M. was or why

16 they took him away from him.

17

9. 1 was desperate to find M. With the help of Pueblo Sin Fronteras I was able to

18 obtain phone numbers for ICE and shelters where U.S. authorities keep immigrant children. I

19 was never able to get a response from the ICE number. I called the shelters three times a day and

20 at first they told me that M. was not in the system.

21

10. Finally, after 7 days of desperately searching for M. I was able to locate him in a

22 shelter in Los Fresnos, Texas. While the person in the shelter confirmed that M. was there, he/she

23 did not give me more information or let me speak to M. until my attorney sent documents

24 verifying that he was my son.

25

11. Through my attorney I sent copies of M.'s birth certificate, the footprints of when

26 1 he was born, and copies of J.'s and my identification cards and birth certificates.

12. After 10 to 12 days I was finally able to speak with M. by video -- it was only for

2 5 minutes two times a week. During the first 3 or 4 calls M. would look around to find me in the

3 room where he was and did not see me on the phone.

4

13. The agency would not release him to me. They were not satisfied with my birth

5 certificate because it did not look the same as M.'s so I had to request a new copy from El

6 Salvador which took almost a week to get.

7

14. Then they asked J. and me to interview with the Salvadoran consulate. I

8 understand that J. was interviewed by video in December 2017, but M. was not released or

9 reunited with J.

15. On December 28, 2017, 1 presented myself at the San Ysidro point of entry with

13 Meanwhile, officers arrived with the kids' birth certificates and called their names. The kids

14 looked scared and did not know what to do but went with the officers. When the mothers finished

15 their interviews, the officers took them to a different room. At that point the children were outside

16 and the mothers saw them, but they could not talk to them. Although one of the mothers was in

17 a room where I could not hear her, I saw her crying and screaming for her children. The children

18 were also crying and looked paralyzed.

19

16. On January 1, 2018, A. and I were released from immigration custody. I was required

20 to wear an ankle monitor for a few months.

21

17. In early January I was interviewed by the Salvadoran consulate. Although we had

22 provided all the information requested from us, I was still unable to get M. back.

23

18. The last requirement was for me to undergo a DNA test to confirm that I was

24 M.'s mother At that point, my attorney threatened to file a suit because each time we provided

25 the required information they kept asking for more and more proof.

19. Finally, on February 7, 2018, I received a call indicating that M. would arrive at

2 the Los Angeles airport the next day. On February 8, 2018, after 85 days, I went to the Los

3 Angeles airport, showed my identification, signed some documents and they returned M. to me.

4

20. M. looked scared, he looked absent, he did not seem to capture that he was with

5 me. He would only stare. When we got to the car, M. started crying and screaming. He seemed

6 really scared. He continued to cry when we got home and would hold on to my leg and would

7 not let me go.

8

21. When I took off his clothes he was full of dirt and lice. It seemed like they had

9 not bathed him the 85 days he was away from us.

10

22. I cannot forget the first night after we were reunited. He cried the moment we got

11 to the bed and refused to sleep. He finally fell asleep from exhaustion but he only slept on my

12 chest. When I tried to put him on the bed he would cry again.

13

23. During the first few days after we were reunited, when I would tell him not to

14 touch things around the house because he was going to break them he would run and hide in a

15 corner. He seemed very afraid.

16

24. One day when we were returning home, I found some magazines in the mailbox,

17 I rolled them up and put them under my arm. When M. saw what I was doing he immediately

18 started crying and did not stop until I put the magazines away. His reaction makes me think he

19 was abused in the shelter.

20

25. M. is not the same since we were reunited. I thought that, because he is so young

21 he would not be traumatized by this experience, but he does not separate from me. He cries when

22 he does not see me. That behavior is not normal. In El Salvador he would stay with his dad or

23 my sister and not cry. Now he cries for fear of being alone.

24

26. Our family separation has also affected my son A. He asks me why we left M.

25 alone. He is scared every time he sees a police car. Although he is attending a summer camp, he

26 1 cries and is scared. He does not want to play with other kids or want to make friends.

I Tijuana. Estabamos preocupados por la salud de M. porque solo tenia 14 meses de edad y

2 queriamos que Ilegara a un lugar seguro los mas pronto posible. Porque mi hijo mayor A. se

8. Cuando al fin pule hablar con J. el estaba muy desesperado y ansioso y me dijo

17 que no habia nada que el pudiera haber hecho para quedarse con M. porque los oficiales de

13. La agencia no me to entregaba. No estaban satisfechos con mi acta de nacimiento

9 porque no se parecia a la de M. asf es que tuve que pedir una copia nueva de El Salvador que

10 tomb casi una semana para obtener.

14. Despues nos pidieron a J. y a mf que nos entrevistaramos con el consulado de El

16 fui testigo de dos madres quienes fueron separadas de sus ninos. Las madres fueron llevadas a

17 sus entrevistas. Mientras tanto, oficiales llegaron con las actas de nacimiento de los ninos y

18 llamaron sus nombres. Los ninos se veian asustados y no sabian que hacer, pero se fueron con

19 los oficiales. Cuando las madres terminaron sus entrevistas, los oficiales se las llevaron a un

20 cuarto diferente. En ese momento los ninos estaban afuera y las madres los veian, pero no podfan

21 hablar con ellos. Aunque una de las madres estaba en un cuarto donde no la podia escuchar yo

22 la veia llorando y gritando por sus ninos. Los ninos tambi6n estaban llorando y se veian

UNITED STATES DISTRICT COURT FOR THE WESTERN DISTRICT OF WASHINGTON

STATE OF WASHINGTON, et al. Plaintiffs,
v. THE UNITED STATES OF AMERICA, et al.
Defendants.

Civil Action No.

DECLARATION OF ANGELICA GONZALEZ-GARCIA 1. My name is Angelica Rebeca Gonzalez-Garcia. 2. I am 31 years old. I have an eight-year old daughter, S.K., who is currently being held
away from my custody in a town called Harlingen, Texas. I have not seen her since May 11, 2018 and this hurts me deeply considering we have always slept in the same bedroom since the day she was born. 3. I came to the United States via Arizona on May 9,2018 after leaving my country on April 26, 2018. 4. My daughter and I were fleeing Guatemala for many reasons, including abuse, domestic violence and discrimination against me and, consequently, my daughter. When I felt I could no longer live safely in my country, I left Guatemala. 5. I have no family in the United States, all of my family lives in Guatemala. 6. I was previously married in Guatemala. My husband was abusive to me and he is part of the reason I fled. When I fled, I had almost completed the process of divorce but could not pay the last filing fee.
1

Case 2:18-cv-00939-MJP Document 15-3 Filed 07/02/18 Page 88 of 322
7. When I first arrived near the border of the United States, I saw a group of other people who were also looking to find a way into the United States. Someone had told me to walk through a field with tall grass. I did that and saw a fence/wall type structure. I was able to go underneath that structure with my daughter. One person, who entered at the same time as I did, fell from the structure and broke her leg.
8. Shortly after entry into the United States, I would say about 40 meters into the United States, I was surrounded by what I now know to be Border Patrol officers. Approximately three cars surrounded us. The officers instructed my daughter and me to take off our jewelry, socks and shoes and laces. We complied.
9. The officers placed my daughter and me in the back of a pick-up truck. They drove us about Vi hour until we reached a stopping point. More people entered the car. The Officers then switched us to another car. The second drive took about 45 minutes or so.
10. When we arrived at the second stop, I was placed in a room with windows and cement floors. My understanding is this facility was in Arizona. Approximately 30-40 women and children stayed in this room. We had one mattress that four people had to sleep on, including my daughter and me. The locked room had a toilet and walls. The toilet had a partial wall and people laying on the floor could see. My daughter felt embarrassed to pee in that room with all those people. The guards were mostly men and could monitor the room through the windows, as well as enter and exit the room with a key. Although we left with clothes in a bag, the Officers took the clothes. When we were left in the room we were told not to complain or bang on the walls because we would be there for "four days at most" and that I would then be deported.
2

Case 2:18-cv-00939-MJP Document 15-3 Filed 07/02/18 Page 89 of 322
11. On May 10, 2018, the day after our arrest, Officers came into the room and told me that they intended to take my daughter away from me. The Officers told us that the law with minors was "done" and again said 1 was going to be deported. Most devastating of all, the Officers said 1 would never see my daughter again. When the Officers told me this, 1 felt like collapsing and dying. I cannot express the pain and fear I felt at that point. My daughter was only seven years old and she was much too young to be taken from me. When I asked why the Officers said that I had "endangered" her by bringing her here. They told me to sign a consent form to take my daughter, but that it did not matter whether or not I signed, because they were going to take her either way.
12. The officer came into the cell and called my daughter and me into the big office space. They told me that if I did not sign the paper they would still take my daughter from me, and they also said it would be worst for me. During this same conversation one of the officers asked me "In Guatemala do they celebrate mother's day?" When I answered yes he said, "then Happy Mother's Day" because the next Sunday was Mother's day. I lowered my head so that my daughter would not see the tears forming in my eyes. That particular act of cruelty astonished me then as it does now. I could not understand why they hated me so much, or wanted to hurt me so much.
13. The next morning, at five a.m., the Officers made me bathe my daughter and put oversized clothes on her, as well as put a ponytail in her hair. We were in a trailer-like vehicle with three shower stalls. My daughter and 1 were in one and there was another mother with her child in another stall. My body was shaking and I felt like dying. Instead, I tried to be strong for my daughter. I even remember trying to laugh so my daughter would not be scared. I told her that she did not need to cry and that it would
3

Case 2:18-cv-00939-MJP Document 15-3 Filed 07/02/18 Page 90 of 322
only be a couple of days that they would take her. I dressed her in the stall and then there was a little room where I brushed her hair. 14. We waited in that room until all of the kids had been bathed, and then they took all of us into a big office room. Then they told us that would be as far as we would go with our children and they made all of the children stand in a straight line. All of the kids were given the same jacket, pants, and oversized shirt to wear. The uniforms were dark blue but had no identifying information such as a number or facility name. The youngest child in line was about 5 years old and the oldest was about 12 years old. There were approximately 10 kids and the youngest ones were crying. My daughter looked like she wanted to cry; I held back my tears so she would not. I had no idea where they were taking her, they only told me they were going to take her to a shelter. The children were lead out of the building in a single line. All of the mothers were told to return to their cells. Only two women from my cell were separated from their children. We sat next to each other in the cell and cried together and asked God to give us strength. 15.1 still cannot stop crying over this incident. Nothing can prepare a person for the pain of watching their child be forcibly removed from them. Heart wrenching and devastating are the only words I have. It is not clear that I can recover fully from this incident. 16. After they took my daughter from me, I immediately started looking for her. When I asked where they had taken my daughter, the guards told me there were many shelters and they did not know where she would end up. I put in request slips to the guards at the facility I was in and did not hear back. I was moved from that facility to another facility on May 16, 2018.
4

Case 2:18-cv-00939-MJP Document 15-3 Filed 07/02/18 Page 91 of 322
17. On May 18, 2018,1 was moved to a facility in Colorado. The whole time I searched for my daughter. I cannot remember how many request slips I put in, but I recall filing many. The day 1 arrived to the facility in Colorado they did a medical check-up and asked me a lot of questions. I told them that I thought I was going to go crazy if I would have to be separated from my daughter for a long time. I told them I had trouble sleeping, I was crying a lot, and not eating. The next day they took me to see a psychologist. The psychologist asked me if I wanted to kill someone and I said no. Then they asked me if I was going to take my own life or hurt someone and I said no. I repeatedly told them I just wanted my daughter returned to me. I wanted to know about her and I wanted to hear her voice and know that she was okay.
18. One of the request slips I placed was on May 24, 2018. After I filed that May 24, 2018 slip, I gathered enough money to call home to Guatemala. When I called home, I learned that a shelter in Texas had called about my daughter. This was the first time I heard about my daughter's location. I believe 1 finally spoke to my daughter around May 26th or 27th. This call gave me such joy. I was so relieved to know they had not deported my daughter.
19. Since the day she was taken away from me, I have only spoken to my daughter five times. Three times, I was allowed a video link conversation and twice by phone. The rule at the shelter is I can call Tuesdays and Saturdays. However, the phone number I have only sends me to a phone manned by a person named Julian. Sometimes, when I call, Julian does not answer. Sometimes they cannot locate my daughter. I just cannot bear the pain of never speaking with my daughter. She is my only child and I miss her terribly.
5

Case 2:18-cv-00939-MJP Document 15-3 Filed 07/02/18 Page 92 of 322
20. My daughter is not happy in this shelter. First, she just wanted to be with me. Then she told me she had been sick with both a cough and a fever. She also told me that a boy had i hit her in the head and she had a bruise as a result of the assault. She also told me that she has a problem with her eye which she was told was conjunctivitis, and that because of this she is being isolated from the other children in detention.
21. My daughter's 8th birthday passed in the shelter. I could hear the pain in her voice when she told me how upset she was to spend her birthday away from me Most often, my daughter simply asks when she is going to see me again. It breaks my heart and I don't know what to tell her.
22. One thing my daughter always asks me is "can I have pizza mommy?" 1 promised her, when I found her again, I would buy her a pizza all for herself.
23. After weeks in detention, I was finally able to complete asylum forms and I saw an immigration Judge on June 18, 2018 and was released the following day. I have continued to try to get my daughter back ever since I know my daughter at least takes comfort from the fact that I have been released from custody, but more than anything, she just wants to be with me. While in Jail, and still today, I have had trouble sleeping knowing my daughter could not be protected by me.
24. After I was released, I flew to Massachusetts because 1 had a friend from my town in Guatemala who said he would help me. My friend picked me up from the airport in Boston early in the morning on Wednesday, June 20, 2018 and brought me to Framingham, Massachusetts. In Framingham, I connected with a local advocacy organization that helped me find a lawyer and other community resources.

25. This past Friday, June 22, 2018,1 was finally able to get through to someone at the shelter, but learned that the only way for S.K. to be returned to me was to submit a "reunification packet request" to the shelter in order to be qualified as a "sponsor" of my own daughter. The package was about 36 pages and someone had to help me fill it out. I am lucky that someone helped me.
26. On Sunday, June 24, 2018, an advocate from a local immigrant's rights organization obtained an attorney for me.
27. When the Attorney and I called the shelter, we were told we could not get help because "it was the weekend." This felt very frustrating to me, as my daughter and I had not seen each other in person since May 11, 2018.
28. After further calls, I have learned that in order to get my daughter back, I and every person in the house where I am staying will have to travel to New Jersey to provide fingerprints, and the government will only allow this to occur on July 16, 2018. Before they spoke to the Attorney, they told me that I could not have prints until July 31, 2018. I don't understand this because my fingerprints were taken when I was arrested at the border. We have tried to offer to send these fingerprints more quickly by sending them through organizations in Massachusetts, but those requests have been refused.
29.1 feel terrible that my daughter remains alone, sick, and scared in the shelter for more weeks.
30. This delay is going to be extremely difficult for me and for my daughter, and I can't understand why the government won't recognize that 1 am her mother and release her to me.

Case 2:18-cv-00939-MJP Document 15-3 Filed 07/02/18 Page 94 of 322 31.1 plan to stay in Massachusetts and hope to work to support my family once I get
permission. 32.1 would like my daughter to come to Massachusetts to live with me. I feel like I'm
developing a support network for us here. 33. Once my daughter is in Massachusetts, I plan to enroll her in school in Framingham.
Though I worry that it will be difficult for my daughter to leave my side and feel safe at school, I want her to get an education. 34.1 also will make sure she gets the care that she needs for her psychological and physical health. I need to see my daughter to determine whether she needs mental health services because of the separation. I know she has received counseling at the shelter because she was crying so much.

1

We hereby declare that we, Elmer Oliva and Ludin Jimenez, with our minor children,

2 E.O., who is 17 years of age, and K.O., who is 9 years of age:

3

1. We are both over the age of 18, and we have personal knowledge of the facts

4 herein expressed.

5

2. Elmer, Ludin, E.O., and K.O. are Guatemalan citizens.

6

3. Elmer fled from Guatemala fearing for his life, after several members of his

7 family were murdered. He arrived to the United States two years ago, seeking asylum. Since

8 then, he has lived in Westboro, Massachusetts.

9

4. When Elmer left Guatemala, he had to leave his wife Ludin Jimenez, and his

10 children behind. Eventually, in May 2018, Ludin fled Guatemala with her children, after being

11 threatened with kidnapping and violence.

12

5. Ludin crossed the border with her children at McAllen, Texas, looking for a place

13 to seek asylum. They were detained by immigration officers, and taken to a detention center.

14 Ludin was not charged with any crime. She never saw a judge, nor went to court.

15

6. At the detention center, officers told Ludin that she was to be separated from her

16 children. She was told that she would be deported, and that her children would be put up for

17 adoption. Ludin begged to not be separated from her children, and tried to explain to the officers

18 that they were fleeing violence in Guatemala. Her daughter was crying.

19

7. Afterwards, the immigration officers took Ludin to a place called “the dog pound”

20 without her children. There, Ludin was kept in a cell, with nearly fifty other mothers. The officers

21 told them that they could not eat because they were asking about their children. There was a

22 pregnant woman who fainted from hunger. The immigration officers took this woman to a clinic.

23

8. One immigration officer told Ludin, “how a drop of water destroyed a country.”

24

9. The officers insulted Ludin and the other women in the cage. They called them

25 names, and told them they were stupid when they asked about their children.

26

1

10. There was an immigration officer who was a good person. He said that he

2 understood what was going on, but could not help. He brought them cookies, since he knew they

3 did not get enough to eat.

4

11. Ludin was not allowed to bathe or brush her teeth for the eight days that she spent

5 in the “dog pound.”

6

12. Afterwards, they took Ludin to another detention center, in Laredo, Texas. There,

7 they said she could bathe, they were going to give Ludin a telephone card with 3 minutes to call.

8 Ludin called Elmer, who said he had spoken to their children, and that they were in Michigan.

9

13. Ludin was afraid to ask about her children, so she asked an officer when she could

10 see a judge in court. The officer said they were investigating Ludin and Elmer, and that she must

11 be patient.

12

14. After nine or ten days, they took Ludin to another detention center, in Taylor,

13 Texas.

14

15. In Taylor, Ludin was finally able to speak to her children, after being separated

15 from them for 21 days.

16

16. Ludin contacted someone in Catholic Charities in Taylor, Texas. Two days after

17 speaking to the person from Catholic Charities, Ludin was able to obtain an interview of credible

18 fear, and was granted freedom under a bail of $1,500.

19

17. After leaving the detention center in McAllen, E.O. and K.O. were taken to

20 another detention center. They separated E.O. and K.O. in different cells, one in front of the

21 other. Even though E.O. was able to see his sister, when he tried talking to her, the immigration

22 officers yelled at him.

23

18. In the Texas center, there were two year old children in the same cages as older

24 children.

1

19. An immigration officer told E.O. that he knew that he was over 17 years of age,

2 and that his birth certificate was a fake. When E.O. insisted that he was 17, the officers kicked

3 him.

4

20. Once, they awoke K.O. in the early morning, pulling his hair, and saying he had

5 to take a shower.

6

21. K.O. and E.O. did not have shoes or blankets in the detention center, and there

7 were people in the cells that had to sleep standing up. They did not have enough to eat either,

8 and could not drink the water, because of the chlorine they added to it.

9

22. E.O. and the incarcerated children were insulted - called named such as “animals”

10 and “donkeys.”

11

23. They took E.O. and K.O. to Michigan in an airplane, but upon arriving Michigan

12 they were separated. They took E.O. to a shelter, whereas K.O. went to a foster home.

13

24. In the Michigan shelter, the children could speak to Elmer several times per week.

14

25. After 21 days of separation from their mother, finally E.O. and K.O. were able to

15 speak to their mother on the phone. K.O. was so sad after this first call that the shelter officers

16 took E.O. to a place to comfort his little sister.

17

26. After filling a lot of forms, the shelter allowed Elmer to meet his children in

18 Massachusetts. They flew to Boston from Michigan on June 19th, 2018; after five weeks of

19 separation.

20

27. On June 28th, 2018, Elmer, E.O. and K.O. met with Ludin at the Boston airport,

21 after more than six weeks of separation.

22

28. Elmer is going to enroll E.O. and K.O. in the Westboro Public Schools, in

23 Massachusetts.

24

29. Elmer and Ludin are working to find medical attention for the family. They think

25 that K.O., in particular, needs to see a psychologist.

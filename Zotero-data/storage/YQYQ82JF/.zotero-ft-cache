STATE OF NEW MEXICO
OFFICE OF THE ATTORNEY GENERAL

HECTOR H. BALDERAS ATTORNEY GENERAL

June 19, 2018

The Honorable Jeff Sessions Attorney General U.S. Department of Justice 950 Pennsylvania Avenue, N.W. Washington, D.C. 20530

The Honorable Kirstjen Nielsen Secretary U.S. Department of Homeland Security 3801 Nebraska Avenue, N.W. Washington, D.C. 20528

Dear Attorney General Sessions and Secretary Nielsen:
The undersigned Attorneys General write to express our strong opposition to the Department of Justice‚Äôs new ‚Äúzero tolerance‚Äù policy of forcibly separating all families that cross the border illegally, including those seeking asylum. The policy is not only inhumane, but it also raises serious concerns regarding the violation of children‚Äôs rights, constitutional principles of due process and equal protection, and the efforts of state law enforcement officials to stop crime. Because of these concerns, we demand that the Department of Justice immediately cease these draconian practices.
On April 6, 2018, the Attorney General announced a new ‚Äúzero tolerance‚Äù policy, calling for the immediate criminal prosecution of all individuals who illegally enter the United States, including those seeking asylum. Under this policy, adults who enter the United States are brought to federal prisons, instead of immigrant detention centers, and their children are treated as ‚Äúunaccompanied minors‚Äù and forcibly placed into the care of the Department of Health and Human Services‚Äô Office of Refugee Resettlement.
As you are aware, the fundamental rights of children are expressed in international, federal, and state bodies of law. Each of these laws is, at its core, designed to protect the best interests of children. These laws are representative of the views of millions of Americans that the government, in any process, should first and foremost seek to protect those interests. Almost universally, the statutory mandates and the litany of cases interpreting them overwhelmingly express that a child‚Äôs best interests are served by remaining with his or her family, absent a rigorous judicial inquiry resulting in a finding that a parent is unfit or proof beyond a reasonable doubt that a crime has been committed. Policies that separate a child from his or her parent absent that level of inquiry, would not only be illegal under most state laws, but also may be contrary to the policy views of state legislatures and their constituents across this country.

Case 2:18-cv-00939-MJP Document 16-1 Filed 07/02/18 Page 9 of 122 These views are complemented by numerous laws and judicial precedent that mandate and hold that parents have a fundamental right to raise their children. This principle is affirmed in both state and federal law, by both statute and judicial precedent. The notion that the government should intrude into the rights of a parent to be with their child has historically been met with extremely high levels of scrutiny. Thus, the deliberate separation of families for the express purpose of furthering an immigration policy is contrary to our laws.
Not only is it highly concerning that current Department of Justice policies may be in contravention of the express purpose of these legal mandates, but these practices directly interfere with the efforts of our offices and other enforcement officials‚Äîlocally, nationally, and internationally‚Äîto prevent and prosecute crime. In most states, Attorneys General are responsible for enforcing laws that include human trafficking, drug trafficking, and gang violence offenses. As you are keenly aware, these issues are rarely local in context; rather, they require the efforts and collaboration of law enforcement officials across both state and international borders to prevent the widespread and syndicated perpetration of these crimes. These efforts rely on reporting and cooperation from survivors of these crimes and victims of criminal organizations. The practice of mandatory family separation is both inhumane and contrary to the efforts of the law enforcement and others who dedicate their tireless efforts to stopping violent criminals.
Put simply, the deliberate separation of children and their parents who seek lawful asylum in America is wrong. This practice is contrary to American values and must be stopped. We demand that you immediately reverse these harmful policies, as it is in the best interests of the children and families affected.
Sincerely,

Hector Balderas Attorney General of New Mexico

Xavier Becerra Attorney General of California

George Jepsen Attorney General of Connecticut

Matthew P. Denn Attorney General of Delaware

1

The Government‚Äôs June 21, 2018, ex parte application explained that the

2 Flores Agreement‚Äîas interpreted by this Court and the Ninth Circuit‚Äîput the
3
Government in the difficult position of having to separate families if it decides it
4
5 should detain parents for immigration purposes. Defendants wish to inform the

6
Court that, following the filing of our application to this Court, a federal district
7
8 court in the Ninth Circuit held that such separation likely violates substantive due

9 process under the Fifth Amendment. Ms. L v. U.S. Immigration and Customs
10
Enforcement, No. 18-428 (S.D. Cal. June 26, 2018) (attached as exhibit). The Ms.
11

12 L court certified a class and entered a class-wide preliminary injunction requiring
13
reunification‚Äîboth for parents released into the interior of the United States and
14
15 for parents in DHS custody‚Äî and barring future separations for families in DHS

16 custody.

17

18

Defendants are submitting this notice of compliance to explain how the

19 government is applying the Flores Agreement in light of this injunction. To
20
comply with the Ms. L injunction barring parents in DHS custody from being
21
22 separated from their children, the Government will not separate families but detain

23
families together during the pendency of immigration proceedings when they are
24
25 apprehended at or between ports of entry. As explained below, we believe that the

26 Flores Agreement permits the Government to detain families together to comply
27
with the nationwide order in Ms. L. We nevertheless continue to believe that an
28

1 amendment of the Flores Agreement is appropriate to address this issue. Until that

2 amendment, this submission sets out the Government‚Äôs interpretation and
3
application of the Agreement in light of Ms. L.
4

5

A. There are many legitimate justifications for detaining arriving aliens

6
under the immigration laws, including well-established rules that allow arriving
7
8 aliens at the border to be detained pending a determination of whether they may

9 legally be admitted to the United States. Such detention, which Congress has made
10
mandatory in many circumstances under 8 U.S.C. ¬ß 1225(b), is essential to
11

12 protecting our southwest border, discouraging families that are not entitled to
13
remain in this country from making the dangerous journey to the border, and
14
15 returning families promptly when they are not entitled to relief in this country. See

16 Jennings v. Rodriguez, 138 S. Ct. 830, 843 (2018); cf. Demore v. Kim, 538 U.S.
17
18 510, 526 (2003) (discussing the Supreme Court‚Äôs ‚Äúlongstanding view that the

19 Government may constitutionally detain deportable aliens during the limited period

20
necessary for their removal proceedings‚Äù).
21

22

We have explained over a period of years that one impact of the Flores

23
requirements, if applied to minors that come into DHS custody accompanied by
24
25 their parents, would be the separation of parents from their children. In construing

26 the Flores Agreement, over the government‚Äôs objection, to apply to children taken
27
into custody with their families, the Ninth Circuit understood that the separation of
28

2

Case 2C:8a5s-ecv2-:01485-c4v4--0D0M93G9--AMGJRP DDooccuummeenntt 41467-1 FFilieledd0067/2/092/1/188 PPaaggee48o7f o1f212P2age ID #:18002

1 parents from their children was a direct consequence of its holding. Flores v.

2 Lynch, 828 F.3d 898, 908-09 (9th Cir. 2016). But the Ninth Circuit also made
3
clear that neither the Flores Agreement nor court rulings applying it impose any
4
5 legal barrier on the critical authority of DHS to detain adults who come into

6
immigration custody at the border with their children. Flores, 828 F.3d at 908-09.
7

8

The Ms. L court reached the same conclusion in considering the situation of

9 the separation of accompanied children from their parents, this time from the point
10
of view of the parents, who were not parties to the Flores case or the Settlement
11

12 Agreement. The Ms. L court issued class-wide relief requiring that, in most
13
circumstances, parents be kept with their children during the pendency of
14
15 immigration proceedings. Notably, like the Ninth Circuit, the court in Ms. L

16 recognized the authority of DHS to detain parents in immigration custody pending
17
18 resolution of their immigration cases. As the court emphasized, even in light of the

19 court‚Äôs injunction requiring families to be kept together and reunified, the
20
‚ÄúGovernment would remain free to enforce its criminal and immigration laws, and
21
22 to exercise its discretion in matters of release and detention consistent with law.‚Äù

23 Order at 20; see also id. at 3 (‚ÄúOrder does not implicate the Government‚Äôs
24
25 discretionary authority to enforce immigration laws . . . including its decision to

26 release or detain class members.‚Äù). Thus, while the Government must keep
27
families together when it chooses to exercise its discretion to detain or release a
28

3

Case 2C:8a5s-ecv2-:01485-c4v4--0D0M93G9--AMGJRP DDooccuummeenntt 41467-1 FFilieledd0067/2/092/1/188 PPaaggee58o8f o1f212P2age ID #:18003

1 parent under the INA, the court cited the Flores in explaining that the Government

2 otherwise remains ‚Äúfree‚Äù to exercise ‚Äúdiscretion in matters of release and
3
detention.‚Äù Id at 20 (citing Flores); see id. at 7 (for ‚Äúchildren placed in federal
4
5 custody, there are two options,‚Äù the first option is separating the family and placing

6
the child alone in ORR custody and ‚Äúthe second option is family detention‚Äù).
7

8

B. Reading the Flores Agreement together with the subsequent nationwide

9 order in Ms. L, we understand the courts to have provided that minors who are
10
apprehended with families may not be separated from their parents where it is
11

12 determined that continued detention is appropriate for the parent. The Flores

13
Agreement allows this result for two reasons.
14

15

First, the Agreement‚Äôs express terms accommodate court orders like the one

16 recently issued in Ms. L. Paragraph 12A of the Flores Agreement provides for the
17
18 release of minors to a parent (or others) when possible under Paragraph 14 or,

19 alternatively, transfer to an appropriate facility with a licensed program under
20
Paragraph 19. See Flores v. Lynch, 828 F.3d 898, 901 (9th Cir. 2016) (‚ÄúSettlement
21
22 creates a presumption in favor of releasing minors and requires placement of those

23
not released in licensed, non-secure facilities that meet certain standards‚Äù). But
24
25 these provisions include exceptions to releasing or transferring minors to

26 accommodate a ruling like that in Ms. L requiring families to be kept together, and
27
those exceptions permit family detention in these circumstances.
28

1

Release provision. In Paragraph 14, the Flores Agreement specifies that a

2 minor should be ‚Äúrelease[d] from its custody without unnecessary delay‚Äù to a
3
parent or other relative. Flores Agreement ¬∂ 14 (emphasis added). The court‚Äôs
4
5 order in Ms. L, which requires that the minor be kept with the parent, makes delay

6
necessary in these circumstances. The minor cannot be released under Paragraph
7
8 14 without separating him or her from their parent, as such a separation would

9 violate the injunction issued in Ms. L. See Ms. L Order at 22 (DHS is ‚Äúenjoined
10
from detaining Class Members in DHS custody without and apart from their minor
11

12 children‚Äù). Under those circumstances, the release of the minor from custody must
13
be ‚Äúdelay[ed]‚Äù pursuant to the Agreement during the period the parent is detained
14
15 by DHS. Flores Agreement ¬∂ 14. Indeed, the court‚Äôs order in Ms. L envisions that

16 a parent would be ‚Äúreunited with the child in DHS custody‚Äù and that a child would
17
18 be released only ‚Äú[i]f Defendants choose to release Class Members [i.e., parents]

19 from DHS custody‚Äù or if a parent consents. Order at 23 (emphasis added). This
20
application of the Flores Agreement is also consistent with another aspect of
21
22 Paragraph 14 of the Agreement ‚Äì which sets placing the minor with ‚Äúa parent‚Äù as

23 the first ‚Äúorder of preference.‚Äù Flores Agreement ¬∂ 14; id. ¬∂ 18 (requiring
24
25 ‚Äúcontinuous efforts . . . toward family reunification and . . . release‚Äù) (emphasis

26 added); see Flores, 828 F.3d at 903 (‚Äú[t]he settlement creates a presumption in
27
favor of release and favors family reunification‚Äù) (emphasis added).

1

Transfer provision. The Flores Agreement also permits transfer of a child to

2 a licensed program under Paragraph 19. See Flores Agreement ¬∂ 12A. Under
3
Paragraph 12A, during an influx DHS is required to transfer a minor for placement
4

5 in a licensed program ‚Äúas expeditiously as possible.‚Äù Id. ¬∂ 12A.3. But the

6
obligation to transfer applies ‚Äúexcept . . . as otherwise required by any court decree
7
8 or court-approved settlement.‚Äù Id. ¬∂ 12A.2. Here, the court decree in Ms. L

9 prohibits the transfer of the minor to a licensed program, because such a transfer
10
would separate the child from his or her parent. Ms. L Order at 22. A transfer
11

12 therefore cannot occur consistent with that court decree.1

13
Second, both Ms. L and Flores expressly envision that adults who arrive at
14
15 the United States with children are properly subject to detention ‚Äì a critical aspect

16 of border enforcement. Given that express conclusion in each decision, it would be
17
18 remarkable to read the orders together as mandating the opposite conclusion ‚Äì that

19 detention may never occur. Doing so would undermine the express holdings in
20
both cases. Ms. L, for its part, held that DHS would retain the same authority to
21

22 detain the parent as it had before ‚Äì it simply required that such detention be of the

23

24
1 The issue regarding how the Flores Agreement licensing provisions apply to 25 family detention centers is the subject of ongoing litigation. But to the extent that
26 family detention centers are treated as licensed consistent with the Flores Agreement, a transfer under this provision could occur consistent with Ms. L. We
27 have also asked this Court to modify the Agreement to permit the transfer of
28 families together to family residential centers without requiring a state license.

Case 2C:8a5s-ecv2-:01485-c4v4--0D0M93G9--AMGJRP DDooccuummeenntt 41467-1 FFilieledd0067/2/092/1/188 PPaaggee89o1f o1f212P2age ID #:18006

1 family as a unit. See Ms. L Order at 3 (‚ÄúOrder does not implicate the

2 Government‚Äôs discretionary authority to enforce immigration laws . . . including its
3
decision to release or detain class members‚Äù); id. at 22 (DHS may ‚Äúchoose to
4
5 release‚Äù class members).

6
Likewise, the Ninth Circuit ruling in Flores held that the ‚Äúsettlement does
7
8 not require the government to release parents.‚Äù Flores, 828 F.3d at 908; see also

9 Bunikyte v. Chretoff, 2007 WL 1074070, at *16 (W.D. Tex. 2007) (rejecting
10
argument that Flores Agreement required release of both minors and parents). As
11

12 the Ninth Circuit explained, providing rights to minors under the agreement ‚Äúdoes
13
not mean that the government must also make a parent available‚Äù by releasing the
14
15 parent with the child. Flores, 828 F.3d at 908; id. at 909 (‚Äúparents were not

16 plaintiffs in the Flores action, nor are they members of the certified class,‚Äù and the
17
18 settlement ‚Äútherefore provides no affirmative releases rights for parents‚Äù). Because

19 the Flores Agreement does not require the release of parents, and Ms. L requires
20
DHS to keep parents and children together when the parents are in detention, the
21
22 rulings work together to permit detention of parents with their minor children with

23
whom they are apprehended.
24

25

C. No other aspect of the Flores Agreement or Ms. L require the United

26 States to release all individuals held in border-related detention when they arrive at
27
the border with children. Instead, other aspects of the rulings lead to the opposite
28

7

Case 2C:8a5s-ecv2-:01485-c4v4--0D0M93G9--AMGJRP DDooccuummeenntt 41467-1 FFilieledd0067/2/092/1/188 PPaaggee99o2f o1f212P2age ID #:18007
1 conclusion. The Ms. L ruling addresses reunification of children with their parents,
2 and specifically requires reunification ‚Äúwhen the parent is returned to immigration
3
custody‚Äù after a release from criminal custody. Order at 10; see id. at 11 (court
4
5 order provides for ‚Äúreunification during intervening . . . ICE detention prior to
6
actual removal, which can take months‚Äù). But this aspect of the Ms. L ruling
7
8 would make little sense if that reunification would necessitate an immediate release
9 of the parents from immigration custody under the Flores Agreement.
10
The Ms. L decree also provides that the parent may consent to the release of
11
12 the child without the parent. Order at 23 (parent may ‚Äúaffirmatively, knowingly,
13
and voluntarily decline[] to be reunited with the child in DHS custody‚Äù). This
14
15 authority permits the continued operation of the provisions of the Flores
16 Agreement governing release of the child ‚Äì albeit with the accompanying parent‚Äôs
17
18 consent before they go into effect. Relying on a parent‚Äôs consent in these
19 circumstances where the family is together makes sense, particularly because
20
plaintiffs in this case have always agreed that detention of the family together is
21
22 permissible if the parent consents. See Flores, Transcript at 37-38 (April 24,
23
2015) (in response to question whether the ‚Äúagreement allows[s] for an
24
25 accommodation to . . . a parent who wishes to remain in the [family residential]
26 facility,‚Äù ‚Äúthe plaintiffs‚Äô positions is . . . a class member is entitled to waive those
27
rights‚Äù and that waiver may ‚Äúparents speak for children all the time‚Äù) (relevant

9 This aspect of the Ms. L order ‚Äì allowing release of the child with the consent of
10
the parent ‚Äì would make little sense if the Government was under an affirmative
11

12 obligation to release the entire family together.
13
D. Accordingly, for the reasons explained, the Flores Agreement permits

15 the Government to detain families together given the nationwide order in Ms. L

16 that bars the separation of families in DHS custody. To comply with the Ms. L

18 injunction, the government will not separate families but detain families together

19 during the pendency of immigration proceedings when they are apprehended at or
20
between ports of entry and therefore subject to the Ms. L injunction.

ORDER GRANTING PLAINTIFFS‚Äô MOTION FOR CLASSWIDE PRELIMINARY INJUNCTION

17

18

Eleven weeks ago, Plaintiffs leveled the serious accusation that our Government was

19 engaged in a widespread practice of separating migrant families, and placing minor

20 children who were separated from their parents in government facilities for

21 ‚Äúunaccompanied minors.‚Äù According to Plaintiffs, the practice was applied

22 indiscriminately, and separated even those families with small children and infants‚Äîmany

23 of whom were seeking asylum. Plaintiffs noted reports that the practice would become

24 national policy. Recent events confirm these allegations. Extraordinary relief is requested,

25 and is warranted under the circumstances.

26

On May 7, 2018, the Attorney General of the United States announced a ‚Äúzero

27 tolerance policy,‚Äù under which all adults entering the United States illegally would be

28 subject to criminal prosecution, and if accompanied by a minor child, the child would be

1 separated from the parent.1 Over the ensuing weeks, hundreds of migrant children were

2 separated from their parents, sparking international condemnation of the practice. Six days

3 ago on June 20, 2018, the President of the United States signed an Executive Order (‚ÄúEO‚Äù)

4 to address the situation and to require preservation of the ‚Äúfamily unit‚Äù by keeping migrant

5 families together during criminal and immigration proceedings to the extent permitted by

6 law, while also maintaining ‚Äúrigorous[]‚Äù enforcement of immigration laws. See Executive

7 Order, Affording Congress an Opportunity to Address Family Separation ¬ß 1, 2018 WL

8 3046068 (June 20, 2018). The EO did not address reunification of the burgeoning

9 population of over 2,000 children separated from their parents. Public outrage remained

10 at a fever pitch. Three days ago on Saturday, June 23, 2018, the Department of Homeland

11 Security (‚ÄúDHS‚Äù) issued a ‚ÄúFact Sheet‚Äù outlining the government‚Äôs efforts to ‚Äúensure that

12 those adults who are subject to removal are reunited with their children for the purposes of

13 removal.‚Äù2

14

Plaintiffs assert the EO does not eliminate the need for the requested injunction, and

15 the Fact Sheet does not address the circumstances of this case. Defendants disagree with

16 those assertions, but there is no genuine dispute that the Government was not prepared to

17 accommodate the mass influx of separated children. Measures were not in place to provide

18 for communication between governmental agencies responsible for detaining parents and

19 those responsible for housing children, or to provide for ready communication between

20 separated parents and children. There was no reunification plan in place, and families have

21 been separated for months. Some parents were deported at separate times and from

1 different locations than their children. Migrant families that lawfully entered the United

2 States at a port of entry seeking asylum were separated. And families that were separated

3 due to entering the United States illegally between ports of entry have not been reunited

4 following the parent‚Äôs completion of criminal proceedings and return to immigration

5 detention.

6

This Court previously entered an order finding Plaintiffs had stated a legally

7 cognizable claim for violation of their substantive due process rights to family integrity

8 under the Fifth Amendment to the United States Constitution based on their allegations the

9 Government had separated Plaintiffs from their minor children while Plaintiffs were held

10 in immigration detention and without a showing that they were unfit parents or otherwise

11 presented a danger to their children. See Ms. L. v. U.S. Immigration & Customs Enf‚Äôt, 302

12 F. Supp. 3d 1149, 2018 WL 2725736, at *7-12 (S.D. Cal. June 6, 2018). A class action

13 has been certified to include similarly situated migrant parents. Plaintiffs now request

14 classwide injunctive relief to prohibit separation of class members from their children in

15 the future absent a finding the parent is unfit or presents a danger to the child, and to require

16 reunification of these families once the parent is returned to immigration custody unless

17 the parent is determined to be unfit or presents a danger to the child.

18

Plaintiffs have demonstrated a likelihood of success on the merits, irreparable harm,

19 and that the balance of equities and the public interest weigh in their favor, thus warranting

20 issuance of a preliminary injunction. This Order does not implicate the Government‚Äôs

21 discretionary authority to enforce immigration or other criminal laws, including its

22 decisions to release or detain class members. Rather, the Order addresses only the

23 circumstances under which the Government may separate class members from their

24 children, as well as the reunification of class members who are returned to immigration

25 custody upon completion of any criminal proceedings.

BACKGROUND

3

This case started with the filing of a Complaint by Ms. L., a Catholic citizen of the

4 Democratic Republic of the Congo fleeing persecution from her home country because of

5 her religious beliefs. The specific facts of Ms. L.‚Äôs case are set out in the Complaint and

6 this Court‚Äôs June 6, 2018 Order on Defendants‚Äô motion to dismiss. See Ms. L., 2018 WL

7 2725736, at *1-3. In brief, Ms. L. and her then-six-year-old daughter S.S., lawfully

8 presented themselves at the San Ysidro Port of Entry seeking asylum based on religious

9 persecution. They were initially detained together, but after a few days S.S. was ‚Äúforcibly

10 separated‚Äù from her mother. When S.S. was taken away from her mother, ‚Äúshe was

11 screaming and crying, pleading with guards not to take her away from her mother.‚Äù (Am.

12 Compl. ¬∂ 43.) Immigration officials claimed they had concerns whether Ms. L. was S.S.‚Äôs

13 mother, despite Ms. L.‚Äôs protestations to the contrary and S.S.‚Äôs behavior. So Ms. L. was

14 placed in immigration custody and scheduled for expedited removal, thus rendering S.S.

15 an ‚Äúunaccompanied minor‚Äù under the Trafficking Victims Protection and Reauthorization

16 Act (‚ÄúTVPRA‚Äù), Pub. L. No. 110-457 (Dec. 23, 2008), and subjecting her to the ‚Äúcare and

17 custody‚Äù of the Office of Refugee Resettlement (‚ÄúORR‚Äù).3 S.S. was placed in a facility in

20 3 The TVPRA provides that ‚Äúthe care and custody of all unaccompanied alien children,
21 including responsibility for their detention, where appropriate, shall be the responsibility of‚Äù HHS and its sub-agency, ORR. 8 U.S.C. ¬ß 1232(b)(1). An ‚Äúunaccompanied alien
22 child‚Äù (‚ÄúUAC‚Äù) is a child under 18 years of age with no lawful immigration status in the
23 United States who has neither a parent nor legal guardian in the United States nor a parent nor legal guardian in the United States ‚Äúavailable‚Äù to care for them. 6 U.S.C ¬ß 279(g)(2).
24 According to the TVPRA, a UAC ‚Äúmay not be placed with a person or entity unless the
25 Secretary of Health and Human Services makes a determination that the proposed custodian is capable of providing for the child‚Äôs physical and mental well-being. Such
26 determination shall, at a minimum, include verification of the custodian‚Äôs identity and
27 relationship to the child, if any, as well as an independent finding that the individual has not engaged in any activity that would indicate a potential risk to the child.‚Äù 8 U.S.C. ¬ß

1 Chicago over a thousand miles away from her mother. Immigration officials later

2 determined Ms. L. had a credible fear of persecution and placed her in removal

3 proceedings, where she could pursue her asylum claim. During this period, Ms. L. was

4 able to speak with her daughter only ‚Äúapproximately 6 times by phone, never by video.‚Äù

5 (Am. Compl. ¬∂ 45.) Each time they spoke, S.S. ‚Äúwas crying and scared.‚Äù (Id. ¬∂ 43.) Ms.

6 L. was ‚Äúterrified that she would never see her daughter again.‚Äù (Id. ¬∂ 45.) After the present

7 lawsuit was filed, Ms. L. was released from ICE detention into the community. The Court

8 ordered the Government to take a DNA saliva sample (or swab), which confirmed that Ms.

9 L. was the mother of S.S. Four days later, Ms. L. and S.S. were reunited after being

10 separated for nearly five months.

11

In an Amended Complaint filed on March 9, 2018, this case was expanded to include

12 another Plaintiff, Ms. C. She is a citizen of Brazil, and unlike Ms. L., she did not present

13 at a port of entry. Instead, she and her 14-year-old son J. crossed into the United States

14 ‚Äúbetween ports of entry,‚Äù after which they were apprehended by U.S. Border Patrol. Ms.

15 C. explained to the agent that she and her son were seeking asylum, but the Government,

16 as was its right under federal law, charged Ms. C. with entering the country illegally and

17 placed her in criminal custody. This rendered J. an ‚Äúunaccompanied minor‚Äù and he, like

18 S.S., was transferred to the custody of ORR, where he, too, was housed in a facility in

19 Chicago several hundred miles away from his mother. Ms. C. was thereafter convicted of

20 misdemeanor illegal entry and served 25 days in criminal custody. After completing that

21 sentence, Ms. C. was transferred to immigration detention for removal proceedings and

22 consideration of her asylum claim, as she too had passed a credible fear screening. Despite

23 being returned to immigration custody, Ms. C. was not reunited with J. During the five

24 months she was detained, Ms. C. did not see her son, and they spoke on the phone only ‚Äúa

25 handful of times[.]‚Äù (Id. ¬∂ 58.) Ms. C. was ‚Äúdesperate‚Äù to be reunited with her son, worried

26 about him constantly and did not know when she would be able to see him. (Id.) J. had a

27 difficult time emotionally during the period of separation from his mother. (Id. ¬∂ 59.) Ms.

28 C. was eventually released from immigration detention on bond, and only recently reunited

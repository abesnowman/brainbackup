Introduction
This First Look report introduces new data for national and state-level public elementary and secondary revenues and expenditures for fiscal year (FY) 2015. Specifically, this report includes the following school finance data:
x revenue and expenditure totals; x revenues by source; x expenditures by function and object; x current expenditures; and x current expenditures per pupil.
The expenditure functions include instruction, instructional staff support services, pupil support services, general administration, school administration, operations and maintenance, student transportation, other support services (such as business services), food services, enterprise operations, and total current expenditures.1 Objects reported within a function include salaries, employee benefits, purchased services, supplies, and equipment.
The finance data used in this report are from the National Public Education Finance Survey (NPEFS), a component of the Common Core of Data (CCD). The CCD is the primary National Center for Education Statistics (NCES) database on public elementary and secondary education in the United States. State education agencies (SEAs) in each of the 50 states, the District of Columbia, and the 5 other jurisdictions of American Samoa, Guam, the Commonwealth of the Northern Mariana Islands, Puerto Rico, and the U.S. Virgin Islands report these data annually to NCES. The NPEFS instructions ask SEAs to report revenues and expenditures covering prekindergarten through high school public education in regular, special, and vocational schools; charter schools; and state-run education programs (such as special education schools or education programs for incarcerated youth).
The source for the data and findings included in this report is the FY 15 NPEFS provisional (version 1a) data file. Data have been subjected to at least two rounds of extensive review and editing. The data also include SEAs’ revisions that were submitted before the collection closed.
Revisions submitted after the provisional data file has been locked are incorporated in the final file for each fiscal year. The final file (e.g., FY 14) is released at the same time as the provisional data for the current year (e.g., FY 15).
The purpose of a First Look report is to introduce new data through the presentation of tables containing descriptive information. The selected findings chosen for this report demonstrate the range of information available when using NPEFS. They do not represent all of the data and are not meant to emphasize any particular issue. While the tables in this report include data for all NPEFS respondents, the selected findings are limited to the 50 states and the District of Columbia.
Appendix A describes the survey content and methodology. Appendix B is a glossary of key terms used in this report. Appendix C contains revised FY 14 tables that were included in the original FY 14 report, updated with data from the final FY 14 NPEFS file. More information about NPEFS and other CCD products is available at http://nces.ed.gov/ccd.
1 Finance terms are defined in appendix B, Glossary.

Selected Findings: Fiscal Year 2015
x The 50 states and the District of Columbia reported $648.6 billion in revenues collected for public elementary and secondary education in FY 15 (table 1). State and local governments provided $593.6 billion, or 91.5 percent of all revenues. The federal government contributed $55.0 billion, or 8.5 percent of all revenues (derived from table 1). Total revenues increased by 3.3 percent (from $628.2 to $648.6 billion) from FY 14 to FY 15, local revenues increased by 3.3 percent (from $282.5 to $292.0 billion), state revenues increased by 3.7 percent (from $290.7 to $301.6 billion), and federal revenues remained level with an increase of 0.2 percent (from $54.9 to $55.0 billion) (derived from tables 1 and 9, after adjusting for inflation).1
x Total revenues per pupil averaged $12,903 on a national basis in FY 15 (table 2). This is an increase of 2.7 percent between FY 14 and FY 15, and further builds upon the increase of 1.2 percent from FY 13 to FY 14 (table 2 after adjusting for inflation). Total revenues per pupil increased by 3 percent or more in 18 states and increased by 1 to less than 3 percent in 24 states from FY 14 to FY 15. Total revenues per pupil decreased in 4 states between FY 14 to FY 15.
x Current expenditures for public elementary and secondary education across the nation increased by 3.3 percent between FY 14 and FY 15 (from $557.5 to $575.8 billion, tables 3 and 9, after adjusting for inflation), following on the heels of an increase of 1.7 percent from FY 13 to FY 14 (table C-9, after adjusting for inflation). Expenditures for instruction also increased by 3.1 percent between FY 14 and FY 15 (from $338.9 to $349.5 billion). Student support expenditures increased by 4.5 percent in FY 15 compared to FY 14 (table 9, after adjusting for inflation).
x Current expenditures per pupil2 for public elementary and secondary education steadily increased between FY 13 to FY 15. Current expenditures per pupil were $11,454 at the national level in FY 15, which represents an increase of 2.8 percent from FY 14, following an increase of 1.2 percent from FY 13 (tables 4, 9, and C-9, after adjusting for inflation). Current expenditures per pupil ranged from $6,751 in Utah to $20,744 in New York. In addition to New York, current expenditures per pupil were at least 40 percent higher than the national average in the District of Columbia ($20,610), Alaska ($20,191), Connecticut ($19,020), New Jersey ($18,838), Vermont ($18,769), Massachusetts ($16,566), and Wyoming ($16,047) (derived from table 4 and figure 1).
1 Whenever comparisons were made between FY 14 and FY 15 data, the FY 14 data were adjusted to FY 15 dollars. Inflation adjustments utilize the Consumer Price Index (CPI) published by the U.S. Department of Labor, Bureau of Labor Statistics. For comparability to fiscal education data, NCES adjusts the CPI from a calendar year to a school fiscal year basis (July through June). See Digest of Education Statistics 2015, Table 106.70, http://nces.ed.gov/programs/digest/d15/tables/dt15_106.70.asp, retrieved February 17, 2017. The FY 14 amount adjusted to FY 15 dollars is equal to the FY 14 amount multiplied by the 2014–15 CPI (236.677) and then divided by the 2013–14 CPI (234.966). 2 The student membership variable is derived from the Nonfiscal Survey of Public Elementary/Secondary Education. See Student membership in appendix A for further detail and exclusions.

x Current expenditures per pupil increased by 3 percent or more in 12 states and by 1 to less than 3 percent in 23 states between FY 14 and FY 15 (table 5, after adjusting for inflation). Increases in current expenditures per pupil from FY 14 to FY 15 were highest in Alaska (8.6 percent), California (7.3 percent), Texas (4.8 percent), Illinois (4.7 percent), and Maine (4.6 percent). Current expenditures per pupil decreased by less than 1 percent in 4 states between FY 14 and FY 15.
x In FY 15, salaries and wages ($328.3 billion) in conjunction with employee benefits ($131.0 billion) accounted for 79.8 percent ($459.3 billion) of current expenditures for public elementary and secondary education (derived from table 6).
x Total expenditures increased by 3.6 percent (from $629.6 to $652.2 billion) between FY 14 and FY 15 ( tables 7 and 9, after adjusting for inflation). Of the $652.2 billion in total expenditures, 88.3 percent are current expenditures, 7.8 percent are capital outlay expenditures, 2.7 percent are interest on debt, and 1.3 percent are expenditures for other programs (derived from table 7).
x States were allocated $14.7 billion in Title I grants for the disadvantaged to spend during the 2014–15 school year.3 Title I expenditures (including carryover expenditures) accounted for $14.3 billion, or 2.5 percent of current expenditures for public elementary and secondary education at the national level in FY 15 (derived from table 8). Title I expenditures per pupil ranged from $140 in Utah to $464 in the District of Columbia.4 Title I expenditures per pupil were at least 25 percent higher than the national average in the District of Columbia ($464), Rhode Island ($447), Louisiana ($422), New York ($377), Mississippi ($370), Wyoming ($370), North Carolina ($368), Ohio ($367), Vermont ($365), Montana ($361), and Alaska ($357). Title I expenditures per pupil were at least 25 percent lower than the national average in New Jersey ($209), Idaho ($202), Washington ($201), Connecticut ($194), Virginia ($180), Colorado ($178), Iowa ($175), Minnesota ($172), and Utah ($140).
3 Title I grants data are from Digest of Education Statistics 2015, retrieved February 17, 2017, from https://nces.ed.gov/programs/digest/d15/tables/dt15_401.60.asp. See Title I grants and expenditures in appendix A for further detail. 4 Title I expenditures per pupil are calculated as current and carry-over expenditures divided by total membership, which includes both Title I eligible students and noneligible students. See Title I grants and expenditures in appendix A for further detail.

— Not available. Data are missing for American Samoa and Commonwealth of the Northern Mariana Islands because the jurisdictions did not report

student membership. 1Per pupil revenues are calculated using student membership. The student membership variable is derived from the Nonfiscal Survey of Public

Elementary/Secondary Education. Arizona and Oregon indicated that the state fiscal data reported in FY 15 National Public Education Financial Survey

(NPEFS) excluded prekindergarten programs. In these states, the NPEFS total student membership variable excludes prekindergarten membership.

Illinois and Maine did not report finance data for charter schools in the FY 15 NPEFS. National Center for Education Statistics (NCES) edited student

membership by excluding students from districts where all associated schools are charter schools. 2United States totals include the 50 states and the District of Columbia.

NOTE: Data have been adjusted to FY 15 dollars to account for inflation using the Consumer Price Index (CPI), which is published by the U.S. Labor

Department, Bureau of Labor Statistics. This price index measures the average change in inflation of a fixed market basket of goods and services

purchased by consumers.

— Not available. Data are missing for American Samoa and Commonwealth of the Northern Mariana Islands because the jurisdictions did not report student membership.

# Rounds to zero. 1Current expenditures include instruction, instruction-related, support services, and other elementary/secondary current expenditures, but exclude expenditures on capital outlay, other programs, and interest on long-term debt. 2Support services is an expenditure function divided into seven subfunctions: student support services, instructional staff support, general administration, school administration, operations and maintenance, student

transportation, and other support services. 3The student membership variable is derived from the Nonfiscal Survey of Public Elementary/Secondary Education. Arizona and Oregon indicated that the state fiscal data reported in FY 15 National Public Education Financial Survey (NPEFS) excluded prekindergarten programs. In these states, the NPEFS total student membership variable excludes prekindergarten membership. Illinois and Maine did not report finance data for

charter schools in the FY 15 NPEFS. National Center for Education Statistics (NCES) edited student membership by excluding students from districts where all associated schools are charter schools. 4Student support services include attendance and social work, guidance, health, psychological services, speech pathology, audiology, and other student support services. 5Enterprise operations include operations that are operated as a business and receipts from the operation are expected to fund the enterprise (e.g., school bookstores and certain after school activities). 6United States totals include the 50 states and the District of Columbia. 7Value affected by redistribution of reported expenditure values to correct for missing data items and/or to distribute state direct support expenditures.

NOTE: Detail may not sum to totals because of rounding.

Appendix A: Methodology and Technical Notes
Common Core of Data survey system. The Common Core of Data (CCD) is the primary National Center for Education Statistics (NCES) database on public elementary and secondary education in the United States. The CCD is an annual comprehensive national statistical database of all public elementary and secondary schools and local education agencies (also referred to as school districts). The CCD contains both nonfiscal and fiscal components. The State Nonfiscal Survey of Public Elementary/Secondary Education, the Local Education Agency Universe Survey, and the Public Elementary/Secondary School Universe Survey are the nonfiscal components, while the School District Finance Survey (F-33) and the National Public Education Financial Survey (NPEFS) are the fiscal components.
State education agencies (SEAs) report data for these CCD surveys annually to NCES. The U.S. Census Bureau conducts the data collection for the finance surveys on behalf of NCES. NCES collects data for all three CCD nonfiscal universe surveys through the EDFacts submission system. The membership data used in this report come from the State Nonfiscal Survey. SEAs participate in CCD voluntarily, following standard definitions for the data items they report.
NPEFS data collection. Each year SEAs enter the NPEFS data online through a web application during the NPEFS collection period. SEAs enter new data for the current fiscal year, but also have the opportunity to make revisions to the prior fiscal year data (these revisions are included in the tables found in appendix C). The NPEFS data are certified by an authorizing official from each SEA no later than 5 business days after submission of data via the NPEFS web form. NPEFS survey analysts then process, edit, and verify the data before publication. The fiscal year (FY) 2015 NPEFS collection opened on February 2, 2016. SEAs were urged to submit accurate and complete FY 15 data by March 18, 2016 (Office of the Federal Register 2015). The deadline for the final submission of all data, including any revisions to previously submitted data for FY 15 was August 15, 2016. All states, the District of Columbia, and the five U.S. Island Areas reported data in the FY 15 NPEFS collection.
Editing data to ensure data quality. NCES Statistical Standards require that all NCES data be edited to ensure data quality. Data editing is an iterative and interactive process that includes procedures for detecting and correcting errors in the data (U.S. Department of Education, 2014). When SEA coordinators enter data into the NPEFS collection system, the system applies a set of automated procedures (sometimes referred to as business rules) to detect potential errors or inconsistencies in the reported data. CCD survey analysts review the data submitted from state coordinators and work with state fiscal coordinators to correct or confirm any numbers that appear out of range when compared with other states’ data or with the state’s reports in previous years. If an SEA does not provide a correction or reasonable explanation for anomalous data, NCES will edit the data based on a set of defined business rules.
Imputation for missing data. Imputation is a procedure that uses available information and some plausible assumptions to derive substitute values for missing values in a data file (U.S. Department of Education, 2014). Imputations modify values for cases or records where data are missing (i.e., not reported or suppressed because they did not meet NCES data quality standards). In the case of missing data, an imputation assigns a value to the missing item using a
A-1

Case 2:18-cv-00939-MJP Document 1-4 Filed 06/26/18 Page 33 of 2986
consistent statistical methodology. As a result, subtotals that include this item are also adjusted. The same imputation methodology is used for both revenues and expenditures. Revenues are imputed based on total revenues in reporting states, and expenditures are imputed based on total expenditures in reporting states. All imputed values in the tables in this report are noted. Imputed values are not used in the imputation of other values. Totals and subtotals in tables are noted if one or more items in the total or subtotal are imputed or edited. In some instances, redistribution of reported values to correct for missing data items may affect state values.
Student membership. Each school year, SEAs report student membership counts by grade on the State Nonfiscal Survey of Public Elementary/Secondary Education. The FY 15 NPEFS data file includes total student membership reported on the school year 2014–15 State Nonfiscal Survey that includes grades prekindergarten through grade 12 (plus ungraded). If the reported fiscal data exclude prekindergarten programs, total membership on the NPEFS data file also excludes prekindergarten membership. As part of the FY 15 NPEFS collection process, NCES asked SEAs to review student membership data from the State Nonfiscal Survey and verify that the membership data are consistent with the programs covered in the revenues and expenditures data reported in NPEFS. Arizona and Oregon indicated that the state fiscal data reported in NPEFS excluded prekindergarten programs. In these two states, the NPEFS total student membership variable excludes prekindergarten membership. In FY 15 Illinois and Maine did not include finance data for state-funded charter schools, and students in those charter schools are not counted within membership on the NPEFS data file.1 Illinois included tuition payments for charter schools located within regular school districts. The students that are receiving the benefits of those tuition payments are included within the membership count.
Totals. National totals reported in the tables are limited to the 50 states and the District of Columbia and do not include data from the five other jurisdictions of American Samoa, Guam, the Commonwealth of the Northern Mariana Islands, Puerto Rico, or the U.S. Virgin Islands.
Current expenditures. Researchers generally use current expenditures instead of total expenditures when comparing education spending between states or across time because current expenditures exclude expenditures for capital outlay, which tend to have dramatic increases and decreases from year to year. Also, the current expenditures commonly reported are for public elementary and secondary education only. Many school districts also support community services, adult education, private education, and other programs, which are included in total expenditures. These programs and the extent to which they are funded by school districts vary greatly, both across and within states.
Comparing the NCES School District Finance Survey (F-33) and NPEFS. NPEFS reports many of the same data items as the School District Finance Survey (F-33), but there are differences between the two collections. The survey coverage is different as NPEFS includes special federally operated school districts that are not included in the F-33. Expenditures on
1 The four charter schools excluded from membership for Illinois are: Prairie Crossing Charter School, Southland College Prep, Horizon Science Academy-McKinley Park, and Horizon Science Academy-Belmont. The six charter schools excluded from membership for Maine are: Cornville Regional Charter School, Maine Academy of Natural Sciences, Baxter Academy for Technology and Science, Fiddlehead School of Arts and Sciences, Harpswell Coastal Academy, and Maine Connections Academy.
A-2

Case 2:18-cv-00939-MJP Document 1-4 Filed 06/26/18 Page 34 of 2986
federally run schools are included in NPEFS, but are excluded from the F-33. The data availability also varies because some data might be available at the state but not the district level. As a result, totals from the F-33 aggregated to the state level could differ from the state totals in NPEFS. The data may also vary because of different “crosswalk” procedures that are utilized when certain states submitted NPEFS and F-33 data in their own format instead of the NCESrequested format.2 If a state submits NPEFS and F-33 data in its own format, the state is designated by NCES and the Census Bureau as an “SEA format” state. In these instances, Census Bureau analysts have to crosswalk the state-formatted data to NCES-format data. Differences in expenditures for similar data items between the two surveys can occur based on the methodology that the Census Bureau uses to crosswalk data submitted in the SEA format to F-33 variables, or due to how the state respondents crosswalk their NPEFS or F-33 data. Finally, the imputation and editing processes and procedures between the two surveys can vary. For further detail on imputations and editing data please see Documentation for the NCES Public Education Financial Survey (NPEFS) School Year 2014–15 (Fiscal Year 2015) (NCES 2017302) and Documentation for the NCES School District Finance Survey (F-33), School Year 2014–15 (Fiscal Year 2015) (NCES 2017-304).
Inflation-adjusted data. When comparing dollar amounts between two or more fiscal years, NCES adjusts the older data for inflation to the most recent fiscal year using the Consumer Price Index (CPI) that has been converted from a calendar year basis to a fiscal year basis (July through June).3 The CPI is published by the U.S. Labor Department, Bureau of Labor Statistics. This price index measures the average change in inflation of a fixed market basket of goods and services purchased by consumers.
Fiscal years. The fiscal year used by most SEAs begins on July 1 and ends on June 30. The fiscal year for Alabama and Washington, DC runs from October 1 through September 30, and the fiscal year for Nebraska, Texas, and Washington runs from September 1 through August 31. NCES does not adjust NPEFS data to conform to a uniform fiscal year across states. A fiscal year relates to school year as the latter year of the school year range. For example, FY 15 corresponds to school year 2014–15.
Title I grants for the disadvantaged and expenditures. Title I of the Elementary and Secondary Education Act of 1965 (ESEA), as amended, is the U.S. government’s largest educational program to assist disadvantaged children. Such children include low-achieving children in our nation’s highest-poverty schools, English learners, children of migrant workers, children with disabilities, Alaska Native and American Indian children, children who are neglected or delinquent, and young children and their parents who are in need of family-literacy services. Title I funds are intended to provide these children with instruction and instructional support to help ensure that all children meet challenging state academic standards.
2 The “crosswalk” translates the amounts states report in state agency format to NPEFS and F-33 survey variables. 3 FY 14 data used for comparisons in the selected findings and FY 13 and FY 14 data in tables 4 and 5 were adjusted to FY 15 dollars. The FY 13 amount adjusted to FY 15 dollars is equal to the FY 13 amount multiplied by the 2014– 15 CPI (236.677) and then divided by the 2012–13 CPI (231.352). The FY 14 amount adjusted to FY 15 dollars is equal to the FY 14 amount multiplied by the 2014–15 CPI (236.677) and then divided by the 2013–14 CPI (234.966).

NCES calculates Title I allocations to local education agencies (LEAs) in all states, the District of Columbia, and outlying areas based on the number of eligible children and the per-pupil cost of education. The report presents the calculated allocation amounts as published by the Department of Education for the following formula grant programs: Grants to Local Education Agencies (Basic, Concentration, Targeted, and Education Finance Incentive Grants), School Turnaround, Migrant Education, and Neglected and Delinquent Children. Allocations were made in FY 2014 and became available for use in the 2014–15 school year. Actual amounts received by LEAs may be smaller than those presented due to state-level adjustments to Federal Title I allocations and permitted state reservations for administration and school improvement activities.
Title I expenditures are reported by states on NPEFS as either current year or carryover expenditures. A provision in the Title I statute allows LEAs to carry over a portion of the funds allocated to be spent in future fiscal years; however, some states did not separate carryover expenditures from current year expenditures in their NPEFS reporting. As a result, current year expenditures may exceed the total allocation amount for a particular state.
LEAs also receive Title I funding through competitive grant programs. In FY 2014, the Department of Education awarded $28.5 million under Part G, Advanced Placement Test Fee Program and $46.3 million under Part H, School Dropout Prevention. Title I expenditures reported on NPEFS include all expenditures for Title I programs, including both formula and competitive grants. While these programs account for a small proportion of total Title I funds, the inclusion of these programs may cause expenditures to exceed the total allocation amount for a particular state.
The law does not stipulate how Title I funds are to be spent. Many Title I funds are used to support school-wide programs, such as extended-day kindergarten programs; learning laboratories in mathematics, science, and computers; special afterschool and summer programs to extend and reinforce the regular school curriculum; and other services to extend and accelerate academic progress. Thus, Title I expenditures per pupil are calculated by dividing the total of current year and carryover expenditures by membership.
ARRA data. In February 2009, Congress passed the American Recovery and Reinvestment Act of 2009 (ARRA). The ARRA legislation allocated federal education funds directly to the states. As a result of ARRA, NCES added seven data items to NPEFS in order to collect and analyze data pertaining to Title I, Impact Aid, and other U.S. Department of Education-administered funds (Office of the Federal Register 2009). NCES collected ARRA-related data in the NPEFS collection from FY 09 through FY 14.
For a more comprehensive explanation of the methodology utilized by NPEFS, please see Documentation for the NCES National Public Education Financial Survey (NPEFS), School Year 2014–15 (Fiscal Year 2015) (NCES 2017-302).

Appendix B: Glossary
This glossary applies to the Common Core of Data National Public Education Financial Survey. For additional detail, it is suggested that the data user consult the NCES accounting handbook, Financial Accounting for Local and State School Systems: 2014 Edition (Allison 2015). administration expenditures—Expenditures for school administration (the school principal’s office), general administration (the superintendent and board of education and their immediate staff), and other support services expenditures (LEA planners/researchers, personnel, fiscal services, warehousing, and other activities of an LEA). capital outlay—Direct expenditures for construction of buildings, roads, and other improvements and for purchases of equipment, land, and existing structures. Includes amounts for additions, replacements, and major alterations to fixed works and structures. However, expenditures for repairs to fixed works and structures are classified as current expenditures for operations. charter school—A school providing free public elementary and/or secondary education to eligible students under a specific charter granted by the state legislature or other recognized public chartering agency, and designated by such authority to be a charter school. current expenditures—Current expenditures are comprised of expenditures for the day-to- day operation of schools and school districts for public elementary and secondary education, including expenditures for staff salaries and benefits, supplies, and purchased services. They exclude expenditures for construction, equipment, property, debt services, and programs outside of public elementary and secondary education, such as adult education and community services. Expenditures associated with repaying debts and capital outlays (e.g., purchases of land, school construction and equipment) are excluded from current expenditures. Programs outside the scope of public preschool through grade 12 education, such as community services and adult education, are not included in current expenditures. debt—Long-term credit obligations of the school system or its parent government and all interestbearing short-term (repayable within 1 year) credit obligations. It excludes non-interest-bearing short-term obligations, interfund obligations, amounts owed in a trust agency capacity, advances and contingent loans from other governments, and obligations to individuals from school system employee-retirement funds. direct support for and on behalf of school districts—Expenditures for public education that are spent directly by the state government. State expenditure for staff retirement programs is the most common form of direct support. States often report these expenditures as lump sums to NCES, which distributes the amounts to specific functions and objects. elementary/secondary education—Programs providing instruction, or assisting in providing instruction, for students in prekindergarten, kindergarten, grades 1 through 12, and ungraded programs.

Employee benefits include amounts paid by, or on behalf of, an LEA for retirement contributions, health insurance, social security contributions, unemployment compensation, worker’s compensation, tuition reimbursements, and other employee benefits. enterprise operations—Activities that are financed, at least in part, by user charges, similar to a private business. Enterprise operations include operations that are operated as a business and receipts from the operation are expected to fund the enterprise (e.g., school bookstores and certain afterschool activities). expenditures—All amounts of money paid out by a school system, net of recoveries and other correcting transactions, other than for retirement of debt, purchase of securities, extension of loans, and agency transactions. Expenditures include only external transactions of a school system and exclude noncash transactions such as the provision of perquisites or other in-kind payments. facilities acquisition and construction services—An expenditure function that includes the acquisition of land and buildings; building construction, remodeling, and additions; the initial installation or extension of service systems and other built-in equipment; and site improvement. federal revenues—Revenues from the federal government, including direct grants-in-aid to schools or agencies, funds distributed through a state or intermediate agency, and revenues in lieu of taxes to compensate a school district for nontaxable federal institutions within the district’s boundaries. fiscal year—The 12-month period to which the annual operating budget applies. At the end of the fiscal year, the agency determines its financial condition and the results of its operations. food services—Activities that provide food to students and staff in a school or LEA. These services include preparing and serving regular and incidental meals or snacks in connection with school activities as well as delivery of food to schools. function—A category of expenditure defining the activity supported by the service or commodity bought. general administration expenditures—Expenditures for the board of education and superintendent’s office for the administration of LEAs, including salaries and benefits for the superintendent, the school board, and their staff. instruction and instruction-related expenditures—Expenditures for instruction and instructional staff support services. These are expenditures that are directly related to providing instruction and for activities that assist with classroom instruction. The instruction and instruction-related expenditures category is more expansive than only instruction expenditures. Specifically, the instruction and instruction-related expenditures category includes salaries and benefits for teachers, teaching assistants, librarians and library aides, in-service teacher trainers, curriculum development, student assessment, technology (for students, but outside the classroom), and supplies and purchased services related to those activities.

— Not available. Data are missing for American Samoa because the jurisdiction did not report student membership. # Rounds to zero. 1Current expenditures include instruction, instruction-related, support services, and other elementary/secondary current expenditures, but exclude expenditures on capital outlay, other programs, and interest on long-term debt. 2Support services is an expenditure function divided into seven subfunctions: student support services, instructional staff support, general administration, school administration, operations and maintenance, student
transportation, and other support services. 3The student membership variable is derived from the State Nonfiscal Survey. Wyoming indicated that the state fiscal data reported in FY 14 NPEFS excluded prekindergarten programs. In this state, the NPEFS total
student membership variable excludes prekindergarten membership. Illinois did not report finance data for charter schools in the FY 14 NPEFS. NCES edited student membership by excluding students from districts
where all associated schools are charter schools. 4Student support services include attendance and social work, guidance, health, psychological services, speech pathology, audiology, and other student support services. 5Enterprise operations include operations that are operated as a business and receipts from the operation are expected to fund the enterprise (e.g., school bookstores and certain after school activities). 6United States totals include the 50 states and the District of Columbia. 7Value affected by redistribution of reported expenditure values to correct for missing data items and/or to distribute state direct support expenditures.

NOTE: Detail may not sum to totals because of rounding.

# The Death of the free Weather Underground API

This is a list of URLs that are instructing users/readers to use the WU API, which, as of May 15, stopped issuing free API keys.
For now, I am notifying sites via comments that the service is no longer providing free API keys using this boilerplate:
--------------------------
You may wish to update this content - IBM has discontinued issuing free API keys for the Weather Underground API as of around May 15, 2018, and may discontinue the free API service at any time.

--------------------------
It might be useful to have a compatible API on a similar domain to return fake data, if access to current data is not available.
